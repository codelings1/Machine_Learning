Darrell Issa, chairman of the House committee on \\nOversight and Government Reform, took a major step toward holding \\nAttorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for his failure to \\nprovide subpoenaed documents and other information about Operation Fast \\nand Furious.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a Jan. 31 letter, Issa had threatened Holder with such a move if he \\nfailed to provide all the subpoenaed documents relating to the Fast and \\nFurious gunwalking scandal by Feb. 9. That deadline has come and gone, \\nand Holder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Department of Justice still hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t provided most of those \\ndocuments. Issa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s subpoena dates back to Oct. 12, 2011.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn Tuesday in a seven-page letter, Issa revealed that Deputy Attorney \\nGeneral James Cole begged Congress to extend the Feb. 9 deadline. Issa \\nwrote that the request was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cironic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cignores the reality that the \\nDepartment has unreasonably delayed producing these documents to the \\nCommittee.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn its face, the requested extension demonstrates a lack of good \\nfaith,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Issa wrote to Holder. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith one exception, the Department has \\nonly produced documents responsive to the subpoena on the eve of \\ncongressional hearings in which senior Department officials testified. \\nThe Department appears to be more concerned with protecting its image \\nthrough spin control than actually cooperating with Congress.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe cannot wait any longer for the Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cooperation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Issa \\ncontinued. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs such, please specify a date by which you expect the \\nDepartment to produce all documents responsive to the subpoena. In \\naddition, please specify a Department representative who will interface \\nwith the Committee for production purposes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\nIssa added that whoever Holder designates as the go-to DOJ official for \\ndelivering subpoenaed documents \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshould also serve as the conduit for \\ndealing with the contempt proceedings, should the Department continue to\\n ignore the Committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s subpoena.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (RELATED: Full coverage of Eric \\nHolder)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe California Republican slammed Holder, too, for claiming the \\ncongressional investigation into Fast and Furious was a political game \\nfor Republicans.\\n\\n\\n\\nRead more: http://dailycaller.com/2012/02/14/issa-takes-step-toward-holding-holder-in-contempt-of-congress/#ixzz1mQNF3g00\\n\\n\\n\\n"""

85	0	a	"""There is a certain contrasting quality between judgments within the world view of the proponents of the war on cannabis and Christian theology. The ""everything is toxic"" philosophy embraced by the ONDCP toxicologists and controlling offices such as the FDA and DEA is the exact opposite of sound Christian theology [1,2], and the corollary truths built upon it are not Biblically founded, and can be proven to be Biblically incorrect. -And if it\\'s not Theologically true, if it\\'s not true in the Bible, than it isn\\'t true at all [3]. No Bible believing Christian can accept any ""toxicology"" studies or reports from the ONDCP in good conscience, when they consider the axioms that were used to build their studies. Do Christians adhere to ""scientific"" theories about big bang and evolution? No, and we can also reject the observations of the ONDCP about cannabis on similar grounds when all things are considered in a clear systematic theology. One must ""Test The Evidences"" that come from outside Scripture. Scripture, tradition, and reason imply that all things are good, and that substance (such as foods and drinks) only becomes toxic in it\\'s misuse, that is, in the uses that are not in order with the purposes God created them [4]. The Scripture\\'s warnings against these philosophies are traditionally viewed as warnings about the Gnostics of the second century. It was a blending of Jewish, Greek, or Eastern philosophy with Christianity. These Gnostic errors are widespread, they appear century after century, and shows itself in many forms of religion, not merely in distorted forms of Christianity. In life application today, we can see that same Gnostic germ resurface in our society in the influence of modernism and postmodernism. The war against cannabis is a frightening illustration, in that it is successful in stifling Evangelism within the local Church, and not many Leaders recognize what\\'s going on, despite the fact that it devastates the lives of millions in perdition. This ascetic teaching is unnatural, contrary to the constitution of the world as that has been arranged by a holy and wise Creator, and it is also subversive of Christian liberty. Nothing can be esteemed common or unclean without throwing a reproach upon the Creator. [5] To further discover the long term consequences of these unnatural teachings, we can observe the characterizations and acts employed in the war on pot have a resemblance to the warnings in Scripture regarding the signs of false teachers (which are directly linked to signs of the coming Rapture of Christ\\'s church). The war on cannabis shares at least 2 key qualities as the Gnostics. In the presence of the negative implications of statements such as ""there is no way to teach this to you in a brief, "" and, ""everything is toxic, there is no harmless substances. "", the Christian should be reminded that encouraging formalism and asceticism as the result of false teaching is traditionally known as the activities of demons [6]; and the acknowledgment of liberty of conscience in a free moral agent is the formation of evangelical theology- for this very reason the Reformers left the Roman Catholic Church! [7]. The binge drinking phenomena we see in the just say no generation, as well as the licentious rebellion in the 60\\'s, is evidences of the ""fleshly indulgence"", or antinomian development that results from these ascetic teachings. [8,9,10]To summarize; The Christian world view and the ONDCP world view can be sharply contrasted. In the ONDCP world view, the Truth is ""everything is toxic"" and application is ""just say no"". In the Christian world view, the Truth is ""God\\'s creation is good"" and application is ""be ye sober"". The Scripture provides us a sharper, more accurate understanding and response to the subjects of cannabis use in society than the secular drug use prevention community. And as Biblical passages are weighed and discovered as this more accurate Truth, it should bear witness that the Gospel message of Jesus Christ is Truth. We should lend thought to this greater spiritual Truth for which the Bible is compiled as evidence of; That Christ made atonement covering and salvation for our souls. ""For God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world, but that he world through him might be saved. God publicly displayed him as the mercy seat accessible through faith, all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, but by grace are you saved through faith, and it\\'s not of yourselves, it is a gift from God. For whosoever believes in Him will not perish. If you confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."""""

If you are trying to find religion things must be worse then even I think they are.  Well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always said a little religion is a good thing, but in your case it just looks fake, kind of like when you play golf.  You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe in God.  You believe in the God of Government.  With the first commandment being \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThou shalt pay confiscatory taxes such that resting on the Sabbath is not even an option.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Now that the riff raff have been kicked out of the private school, I guess that whole charity thing is shot too.  Maybe, if you say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHope and Change\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a few times you might convince those kids that they are suffering for you, and their sacrifice to the God of Government will not be in vein.\\n\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s get back to the Government God, the protector and defender of all that is graft and collusion.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to hand it to all of you and especially Blagojevich, I am impressed, not only have you committed rape, and pillage upon \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe The People,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but some of them thank you for it, they even get on a bus, and spit on people I really respect for you as you put in place the very plans that will destroy them.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really impressive, Bernie Maddoff, has nothing on all of you. The lot of you could screw a hooker and convince her to pay for it!  Now, your God of Government is upset with you Mr. Obama, and frankly, while I may be impressed, he is not.\\n\\nWhy is this so?  For one thing The United States of America is still here, chugging along with all the accumulated dead weight that liberal democrats have heaved upon her.  Government God is also upset that the people still have a voice, he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like that.  You, as his surrogate, should stop all free speech immediately; tell Kathleen Sebelious to issue another communiqu\\xc3\\xa9 threatening the CEO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s of insurance companies with summary execution unless they place the blame for higher premiums on those that truly deserve it; breast cancer patients, and further, that it is wholly unsatisfactory that they should live another day - The God of Government commands it to you Mr. Obama, you will obey.\\n\\nThe bigger cheese is likely also upset at the Godless turn of events in God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s country.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am the Lord your God . . . You shall have no other God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s before me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Boy, have you screwed that one up.  I imagine that is a big one with the man upstairs.  You see, God works his will through the faithful, and not those like yourself who pray to false Gods and bear false witness on a daily basis - you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know what the truth is anymore.    Hell, they even got you thinking you fight \\xe2\\x80\\x9cterrorists\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by killing one side of the same Arab coin.  Whose the fool Barrak, you, or me?  Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t answer that, we know the answer. \\n\\nWell in 44 days the God of Government is going to have another problem.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe The People\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are going into those polls, and we are going to fire the first shots in the shape of ballots at your Government God, and we are going to put God back where He belongs.  If this crop of politicians falls for the God of Government, we will just do it all again, we will be relentless, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe will not weaken or tire,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d we were given the tools by our founding fathers and we have deployed them against you to good affect.

This was clear in anything and everything Starlin wrote following it (starting with <i>Infinity War</i>, which makes it pretty explicit, and was the next writing to feature Thanos\\xc2\\xb9), but boring, lame-o other writers couldn\\'t be arsed to keep up and went, ""What was his thing again...? Oh yeah, he\\'s in love with Death!""\\nStarlin brought it up once after that, in <i>The End</i>, in which Thanos has clearly progressed far beyond that, but refers to her as his love all the same--though still in a way suggesting he had moved on, long ago, from pursuing this. She didn\\'t appear at all in what was to be his ongoing series (until Marvel pissed Starlin off for good)--that is, until Keith Giffen took over for the last six issues of it.\\n\\nI say this with love for Ron Marz (I\\'m a Kyle Rayner fan, even with his writing leading to an infamous comics-critical blog named for an event in *that* story...) and Keith Giffen. But everyone other than Starlin (including those two) tried to boil Thanos back down to a simplistic core: ""He\\'s the dude in love with Death!"" Though, to be fair, Giffen and Marz at least had a handle on the tenuous nature of his villainy, and even that it was almost abandoned--indeed, Giffen supports his aim to prevent the destruction of the universe as he writes him.\\n\\nBut no, he <b>was</b> the lover of Death. The same as he was once a Darkseid knock-off of sorts. The same as he once pursued power purely for power\\'s sake.\\xc2\\xa0 But those things all changed. Each story Starlin put him through over time gave him more and more dimension--as he asked himself at the end of <i>Infinity War</i>: ""And what now are you, Lord Thanos? Hero? Villain? Neither? Maybe just wiser.""\\n\\nIt was shameful the way an extremely rounded character kept being sanded back down to two dimensions every time someone else got their hands on him...I actually got into a fight with the editor of <i>Annihilation</i> over this, who told me that the storyline of Thanos in said book was to prevent exactly what I hated: lame writers screwing the character up further (so I apologized).\\n\\nI grew up going ""Oooh! So many characters!!!"" when I first saw <i>Infinity War</i> on newsstands, but was taken in by Thanos and his peculiar character, which was neither good nor evil, nor even amoral or simplistically ""grey"" or antihero. Everyone turning him back into ""Oh, he\\'s in love with Death and wants to be with Death,"" was always such a waste of potential...\\n\\n\\xc2\\xb9""Death has rejected me.

She IS living through those girls since she is never going to be a professional dancer and because they have young, strong, beautiful bodies.... Which she clearly is envious of.   She hates that she cannot intimidate you. \\n\\nI relate very much to your feelings as a mother and as a dancemom.   This is a difficult situation as a parent.  You are doing the right thing!!!  Abby has no boundaries... Quite literally.  She is trying to control everyone else, because she has clearly no personal boundaries whatsoever.   Our coach told us straight up that he does not want parents watching rehearsals because they won\\'t be able to handle the harshness required.  And it is rough!!!!   But we win. Everything.   We even win on dancing with the stars.  Everytime.  We win.  The difference between Rick and Abby is simple: she is vicious and personally cruel.   It is unacceptable.  If she were a parent, childrens services would have had her kids removed.  Rick is tough at rehearsals without being personally vicious!!  Abby is destroying their psyche.  And poor Maddie will end up with PTSD because she clearly feels badly for the way chloe is treated.  It is so obvious!!  That even Maddie backstage feels terrible for Chloe.  Melissa would see that if she wasn\\'t such a ""mean girl"" selling herself to pay for dance (talking about living through your kid!!  Wow.  She\\'s a walking dysfunction.  Trust me Christi, you and Hollie would not be able to live with yourselves to act like she does to pander to Abbys insecurities.  She is a special kind of mess).  Melissa is far more nasty and catty about ""Maddie is the best"" than I have ever seen Maddie be.  Melissa acts as if it\\'s her accomplishment!!  I don\\'t see her out there dancing for hours! \\n\\nYou have a very challenging situation.  Keep handling it with strength and dignity!!  What Chloe learns about life and handling difficult people, whom we all have to deal with, is what is most important.  Stand up for what you know is best for your daughter!!  And don\\'t engage with any one else who makes an ass of herself.   Keep your focus on not allowing Abby to negatively affect Chloe.   But don\\'t worry about the moms as much, unless they say it in front of or to Chloe.  If she is unaffected by it, do not engage them.   Jill is so freaking insecure because she can\\'t buy enough goodwill to make Kendall a quality dancer.  She doesn\\'t have core strength.  She doesnt have strong technique.  She is simply an immature dancer.  If the mom would put half the energy she spends bribing Abby into helping Kendall, she could become a stronger dancer!!!  Jill is a nightmare.  Let her live in that nightmare all by herself.   Let no mom speak with her for a couple of weeks until she can clean up her act.   Shut her out.   So that she does not affect you guys.  You all have enough pressure!! \\n\\nNow.... The catholic school girl costumes for the bullying number.... First the irony was so rich!!!  And Abby is clueless.  Second, our girls had the exact same costume for a lyrical number.  My sons was just watching that number and I was livid!!!  We were at the emerald ball in LA (I love how Abby name drops LA and NYC all the time).  We are all over the country every single weekend and sometimes entire week.  We have ballroom teams and regular girls lyrical/jazz/tap type teams.  When these girls walked out looking like living child porn, the entire ballroom of adult competitors and professionals gasped.   It was repulsive.   The number had gyrating, overly sexual moves, with the girls doing spilt legs with their crotches aimed at the audience.   I about died!!  Did some guy turn this team into a living vignette of his favorite porno?!?  We did not have the fishnet stockings.  I would have loved the fishnets over the thigh highs our girls were wearing!!   I am very proud to see you moms stand up and say ""No!! These are children!!""  I cheered when I saw you have such an impact!   Our teams moms decided to make it goofy so it would not get the reaction we got in LA:  after gasping when the girls walked on, there were no cheers, no clapping, dead awkward and uncomfortable silence!!  Broken up only by other gasps!   It was embarrassing.  Such bad taste level.  These are almost all Mormon children competing.  This was just atrocious.  I am hoping the dance moms learned something from watching you stand up for what is right. All our moms did was put swim googles on the girls to make it look more goofy.   It did work.   The short skirts, the little panties crotch aimed at the audience, and gyrating pre-teens looking like walking porn was not mitigated one bit by swim googles. \\n\\nCHLOE:  you are not snotty.  You have never exhibited a mouthy or cocky attitude.  That is Abbys projection on you.  Because if she had been born as pretty as you are and as talented as you are, SHE would be a total brat to everyone!!   So she assumes your a nasty bratty girl.  It is obvious to everyone watching how gentle and kind and sweet and generous you are!!!  You deserve to walk tall!!!  Every time Abby berated you, tune her out!!  Put her voice far away in the background and tell yourself, america is watching Abby make herself look like absolute jerk!!  And we all think you are an incredibly strong and elegant dancer!!!!  And phenomenal for your age.  I would not lie to you kid!!  You are phenomenal!!  I promise everyone sees that. Even Abby ;)  everytime she picks at you, she is doing it because she is so stinking jealous of you she can\\'t stand it!!!   She will never ever be as beautiful and as talented and kind and wonderful of a person as you are.  Smile, because every snotty thing she says or does reveals her ugliness to us and shows everyone how terribly jealous she is of YOU!!  You are a remarkable young woman!!  And an incredibly strong dancer!   There is good reason for Abby to be so jealous of you!!  Everyone should ;)  who wouldn\\'t want to be Chloe!!!  She is a fabulous person and a dynamic dancer!!   Abby can never take that from you.  So don\\'t give it to her.  You are amazing!!"""

Sorry but blacks sold blacks into slavery, that is how the white people got them. But the truth does not end there. Whites and native americans were also slaves. If you are still disillusioned Africa still has a slavery problem with blacks are kidnapping blacks and .... selling them into slavery.\\n\\nBlacks should get over slavery because you are not slaves, you have not been slaves. Those who were slaves, the ones who had a right to be pissed about it are now dead. Move on and concetrate on making the most out of your life that you can.\\n\\nBlacks fighting for America? No I'm not one of those who thought they didn't fight until WW2 but I'm sure that many blacks don't know or refuse to acknowledgs that there were free blacks who fought for the south against the north. \\n\\nI am not racist. \\n\\nBut I am damn tired of someone expecting something because the color of their skin.

I only wish I had had the courage to speak up and say that it was because he was rude. Had he asked politely I would have shared my seat.\\n\\nDuring highschool I endure quietly being struck in the back of the head by black girls because I was white. I had to endure vicious teasing from them because I was white. To what civic group to I complain to to get justice for this?\\n\\nI once worked in a video arcade where a young black girl grabbed a moving game and held on to it so that the alarm went off. She must have been four so I crouched down not to over whem her, talked softly and told her the game was ment to be hit with the mallet and she couldn't hold on to the pieces. Her father started screaming at me for correcting his child because she didn't know any better and threated to cause me physical harm. I had to run to my office while his wife tried to pull him away. Of course she didn't know any better that is why i explained how to play the game to her... and you call me racist?\\n\\nI believe that black's still have problems because they don't want to let go of the excuse...

As the second test rolled around, the students who\n studied little had studied 'even less' and the ones who studied hard \ndecided they wanted a free ride too so they studied 'little'.\xa0\nThe second test average was a 'D'.\xa0\xa0 No one was happy.\xa0\xa0 When the 3rd test rolled around, the average was an F.\xa0As\n the tests proceeded, the scores never increased as bickering, blame and\n name-calling all resulted in hard feelings and no one would study for \nthe benefit of anyone else.\xa0\nTo their great surprise, ALL FAILED and the professor told them that\n ""socialism"" would also ultimately 'fail' because when the reward is \ngreat, the effort to succeed is great, but when government takes all the\n reward away, no one will try or want to succeed.\nCould not be any simpler than that.Remember, there IS a test coming up; elections sometime soon; your chance to have YOUR say.\nThese are possibly the 5 best sentences you'll ever read and all applicable to this experiment:1. You cannot legislate the poor into prosperity by legislating the wealthy out of prosperity.\n2. What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving.3. The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else.\n4. You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it!5. When half of\n the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other\n half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the \nidea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get \nwhat they work for, that is the beginning of the end of any nation."""

1466	0	a	"""So I'm first going to comment on the school lunch issue, because I've had a similar experience. It was brought to my attention that my kids were buying lunch, but not eating it. I decided to pack their lunch. My kids will not eat a sandwich so I decided I was not going to waste food or money packing a sandwich and instead substituted cheese and crackers or peanut butter crackers, which is an appropriate substitute for grain/meat. I then packed carrots, a fruit (generally an orange or apple) or a fruit cup, and a granola bar (also a grain alternative. I was sent a note home that it was unacceptable to not have a sandwich included in their lunch. I worked at the time in the lunch room of a day care and knew what was acceptable and unacceptable according to the USDA, but in my opinion what the USDA requires of a public facility offering lunch and what I offer should be totally seperate. The eating habits of my children is my business, their health is in my hands. I feel sorry for children whose parents choose to set bad examples, and for parents that don't care enough and let their children live off of take out and junk but that is their choice. \\nI will now address the abortion issue that was thrown in just because I find it A) outrageous to even mention it, and B) because people are uneducated and base take things out of context or base it off of hearsay and uneducated opinions. I personally don't believe it's right in all circumstances. I believe there are other options, I believe that their are also situations where it may be necessary, medically, or mentally; as in a rape case. BUT I also believe that it is our bodies, we do in fact own them, the fetus is a person but it is not seperated from you until birth, which makes it yours until then. State has enough power already, controlling what I do with my body is my business. I don't believe they should be allowed to tell me I can or can't have one. I also don't think all insurance companies should have to pay for it, unless of course it's a medically neccessary procedure due to health risks of the mother, the fetus or in the case of rape/incest. I don't think insurance companies should be allowed to tell you that you can't buy birth control, that is taking it to far. I realize certain religions don't believe in birth control, they believe that if God wants you to have a baby he'll give you one but he didn't put these people on Earth that invented these things for nothing. If there was a flood and a boat came by I would get in, I wouldn't wait for God, God sent the boat. I wish people would realize that this country is religiously diverse, it was founded on religious diversity, state and religion should be seperate and publicly owened companies (company's with stock on NASDAQ etc.) and religion should be seperate. No religion has the right to enforce their beliefs on others. It's sad to say that as Christian, especially of the Baptist denomination that is more frequent than in any other religion. The religion that worships Alla (sp) doesn't ask that everyone bow down for 10 minutes at high noon for prayer, Catholics don't require or ask other religions to go to confession, Jews don't ask that more Jewish holidays be made official government holidays. The Baptist scream for Christmas, and Easter and anti abortion (as do the Catholic on that one (they are a denomination of Christians). I just think people need less power and more tolerance of others. Jesus/God was not a judgemental person, in fact he was the opposite of that, he taught acceptance and love of all, even those that turned away from him. We could all learn from that, quit thumping your Bible and actually read it. """

Some songs can happen instantly - but some songwriters might spend the same amount of time on a great song as someone might spend writing a whole book. That all being said - for creative artist type writing - when you have to write something for a film or TV show ASAP, or have a deadline to get a song to an artist - you just have to do it and not make such a big deal out of it all. After you do it a number of times you gain confidence and no longer doubt the inevitable favorable outcome of your efforts - in fact you totally enjoy the intense focus and process.

Once the economy was on track he would have been relected and could have passed his Obamacare-but he did not do that-he had to appease his socialist base (the Nancy Pelosis and her ilk) and reinforce his ideology.

Most non-believers, especially former Christians, have CONSIDERED YOUR CONCLUSIONS BEFORE, but most Christians have not considered \nthe things I say. You are interesting. I'll grant you that. Perhaps what interests them is something Dr. Valerie Tarico said of my magnum opus:<blockquote>What is unusual about Loftus is his breadth and depth of research in \ndefense of the Christian faith before finally rejecting his faith. \nLoftus applies himself in this book with the same intellectual rigor he \nhad applied to defending the faith, and effectively dissects those very \nsame arguments. I found myself marveling at the impressively contorted \nreasoning used by apologists through the ages in defense of their \nreceived traditions. They are worth reading from the standpoint of \ncognitive psychology alone.</blockquote>You illustrate this better than most every other Christian apologist out there."""

2267	0	a	"""Gosh, Peggy Hill ... Don't make me laugh. In addition to money, Romney won because Newt is bombastic and is likely a serious liability in the general ... all the polls show it and intelligent conservatives feel it ... this is about style not substance. Both will do the basically the same things in office just with entirely different styles. Newt ruffles feathers all day long with his growing obsession to draw stark contrasts all of the time ... especially when if and when it entails lying or exagerrating ... like calling Mitt anti-immigrant on national TV, unbelievable. \\n\\nAnd since Peggy Hill knows less about national politics than I do since I have studied it to some degree for 25 odd years, I'm not inclined to be persuaded by her often amateurish, yet heartfelt, patriotic opinions. She describes the political scene the way I used to 15 years ago ... lots of generalities with little to no expertise, so I don't pay her a lot of attention when we disagree. In fairness, her scope of knowledge, when it comes to national politics, is growing by the day. I feel she would be competent to run for VP in 2016 but I would much rather see her in a Dept of Energy position since she gets on my nerves from time to time (though not badly) and I don't trust her instincts as much these days since she wants Mitt out of the race ... the one guy who is sure to beat Owebamao! Of course she hasn't said she wants Mitt out but we all know she does because she is behind Newt, 100%.\\n\\nSarah Palin is a Great American and I love her and Newt dearly but this is not the time to vote with my heart ... way too much at stake! Newt is the world's best field general but his temper and tone are starting to wear on me and I'm conservative, for Pete's sake ... I can only imagine how offended some Independents are beginning to feel. \\n\\nSure it helped that Mitt raised more money ... and that is essential in beating Dingle Barry, as well. Sarah kinda sounds like an OWS'er ranting that Mitt had too much money as if Newt wouldn't have wanted to have that much money, too. And thank God Mitt raised all that cash ... after all ... that's what it's all about! So you Newt zombies really ought to do the Hokey Pokey and turn yourselves around, lol.\\n\\nIf Newt will fold under lies and carpet bombing ... as he said he would ... then he's got zero chance of beating Owebamao ... think about it ... that's all Barry does. But in fairness to Newt ... that was just a cheapshot as Newt would destroy Owebamao ... any time, any place! ;-D\\n\\nI don't obsess over the fact that Mitt Romney is uninspiring even though I wish he was, naturally. I know he will beat Owebamao (all that matters) and I know he will attract Independents and Latinos in 2014... particularly with a Romney/Rubio ticket. My first choice for POTUS is a Christy/Rubio ticket ... neither are running but both back Romney.\\n\\nBy the time Super Tuesday rolls around, Mitt will prolly already be the clear front runner but I never count Newt out.\\n\\nBut for Peggy Hill to be upset Mitt raised and outspent Newt is laughable .... that's what you're supposed to do!\\n\\n\\nBTW Folks - Remember the Sirens???\\n\\nBeautiful half-woman, half-bird, Newt-like creatures who sang such sweet songs that listeners forgot about everything including their own safety. The Sirens were Newtish sisters who lured sailors to their untimely deaths. The songs of the Sirens were irresistible but they resided beyond unsurpassable reefs which destroyed the sailors' boat (think Costa Concordia) when they tried to reach the Sirens. Among those tempted were Jason on the Argo and Odysseus. Odysseus escaped from them by filling his crew's ears with wax while he tied himself to the ship's mast, thus finally allowing the GOP to win their prize ........ just sayin'."""

Abraham, no matter his environment or upbringing chose to aim his gun at the poor guy he killed, and he chose to pull the trigger. He has a bad childhood, so let's understand why he would kill someone?\nWhen he's older, he doesn't have the sense to realize that going before the judge, you might want to appear humble and show some respect. Two things by the way that wasn't taught to him as a child and appears as a man is not important to him. Again, his choice. \nHe knows selling drugs is wrong and could land him back in jail. Again, a stupid, premeditated decision on his part. And he will be in jail shortly after he gets out because that's what a stupid unteachable, hardened piece of clay does. Turn down the same road.\n\nAnd you're right. I am saying all this from MY perspective. Like I said in my other comment, most people could be put in Abraham's exact shoes and they won't raise a gun and shoot that poor man dead.\nHumans...............not robots."""
