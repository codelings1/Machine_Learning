In the swamp on the far side of the Far Forest, lived Sniffles, the Crocodile. Sniffles was always crying big crocodile tears or going sniff. . . sniff. . . Even his mom was quite tired of him and would say, “Stop snivelling and crying, start behaving like a crocodile. Go hunt for your food.”But Sniffles would burst into tears at the thought of eating another animal. So mom and dad had to feed Sniffles every day.Sniffles did not want to be a crocodile. 'I am so ugly, ' he thought, bursting into tears. He did not even want to live like crocodiles do. His best friend was Punch, a golden yellow butterfly. And Punch wanted to be big and strong. So Punch always had her feeler curled into a fist saying, “Look out! I will punch you in the mouth.”They made a very funny pair. Sniffles swimming with Punch perched on his head. The other crocodiles would laugh and make fun of them. That did not bother Sniffles. He continued crying, sniffling and being friends with Punch.One sunny afternoon, Punch settled herself near Sniffles’ ear and told him, “I have seen two men come this way with guns, they want to kill crocodiles for their skins.” “Don’t these men have skins of their own?” asked a puzzled Sniffles. “I don’t know Sniffles,” replied Punch. “Tell the other crocodiles and hide.”“But Punch, they might shoot you. Oh! What will I do,” cried Sniffles sobbing loudly. “People catch butterflies with nets and pin them on a board, my grandaunt told me,” said Punch and flew away.The other crocodiles heard Sniffles crying and shouting, “Men coming to kill us. Hide . . . Hurry . . . Hide.” At first the crocodiles did not believe Sniffles, but then they heard the men’s footsteps. The crocodiles went deep into the river and left some rotten logs floating on the water. The men shot at the logs which looked like crocodiles from afar. The men could not see any crocodiles, only hundreds of butterflies that flew into their faces and hair.Shaking their heads and trying to brush off the butterflies they said, “There are no crocodiles here, we will bring nets and catch the butterflies.” And off they went. All the crocodiles got together and said, “Thank you, Punch.” “Thank you, butterflies.”The next day Sniffles saw men with nets. He remembered Punch telling him about nets. “Punch, the nets! Come here quick! The men with the nets have come.” All the crocodiles came on the river bank. The butterflies settled on the backs and heads of the crocodiles.A few of the crocodiles made a circle around the men as they came close. The crocodiles snapped their jaws. Sniffles was in front, gnashing his teeth and whipping his tail around most menacingly.The men were so frightened that they took to their heels and ran right out of the swamp. The other crocodiles were very proud of Sniffles, as he had acted like a real crocodile. Now Sniffles was also proud to be one.All the butterflies flew around the crocodiles, fluttering their wings. “Thank you, Sniffles, Thank you, crocodiles.” “It is all right,” said Sniffles shyly. “That is what friends are for, to take care of each other.”	./Story text files/511.txt	3087	16	5.845201238390093	247	76	166	45.78787878787879	42	24	30	9.196969696969697	33	33	188	135	4	1.3306878306878307	335	43
A long time ago, in the village of Pakshipur, situated at the edge of a forest, lived a young boy called Baku. He loved counting things.After school, he helped his mother weigh vegetables and count money. One evening, Baku saw a pair of colourful birds. They laughed and took off. Baku followed them.They flew through a cave and into the forest. Everything here was so different, just like the birds. Were those blue monkeys whistling? And the pink elephants? They seemed to be humming! Baku didn’t see the sun go down. Soon, it got dark, and he was lost.A short distance away, he saw a roaring fire. A woman was pacing up and down. Her name was Midu. Baku went up to her and asked softly, “Wha. . . what is the matter?”“My tenyearold daughter Koya came down with a rare illness six months ago. She hasn’t been able to sit up since then!” “Is there no cure?” asked Baku. “Only one—the nectar of the Neelumbera flower,” she said. “It blooms every seven days. But only the nectar collected on a full moon night can cure her. In the past six months, the flower hasn’t bloomed even once on a full moon night. Koya is getting weaker every day!”Baku’s mind raced. “Please don’t cry! The flower will bloom on a full moon night. . . hmmm. . . in nine days,” he said confidently. “How can you be sure?” asked Midu.Baku had worked it out. The full moon shone every thirty days and the flower bloomed every seven days. This meant it would bloom on a full moon night once every  days  roughly seven months.Six months had gone by. The Neelumbera would bloom on the next full moon night. That was only nine days away. Midu thanked Baku and led him back to his village.Three weeks later, when Baku was picking jamuns, he saw Midu again. She came running and hugged him.“Baku! Look, that’s my Koya!” she said. “The flower bloomed on the night you said it would. The nectar worked its magic!” Koya was cured. Baku was very pleased. All was well in Midu’s world.How did Baku work it out? Baku knew the Neelumbera flower bloomed once every  days and that the full moon appeared every  days*. How did he know that the blooming of the flower would coincide with the full moon? Mathematics! Actually, something called Lowest Common Multiple (LCM). What is LCM? The LCM of two numbers—let’s call them a and b—is the smallest number which is a common multiple of both a and b. *The lunar cycle—that is one full moon to the next—can last anywhere between  and  days. The average full moon cycle is .  days, which is rounded off to  days.How do you find the LCM? To find the LCM of  and : Write the multiples of : , , , , , , , , , , . . .

"Dhani knew something exciting was being planned at the ashram, but no one would tell him anything. “Just because I’m nine years old,” thought Dhani glumly. “I’m sure they think I’m stupid. I am not!” Dhani and his parents lived in a very special place. It was Mahatma Gandhi’s Sabarmati Ashram near Ahmedabad where people from all over India came to stay. Like Gandhiji, they were all fighting for India’s freedom. During their stay at the ashram, they spent their time spinning khadi thread on charkhas, singing bhajans and listening to Gandhiji’s lectures. At Sabarmati, everyone had to work – cook and clean, wash clothes, fetch water from the well, milk the cows and goats, and grow vegetables. Even Dhani had a job – he had to take care of Binni, one of the ashram’s goats. He quite enjoyed that because Binni was his best friend and he liked talking to her.That morning, as Dhani fed Binni with fresh grass and changed the water in her bowl, he said, “Something’s up, Binni! They all sit and talk in Gandhiji’s room. They are planning something. I know it!” Binni chewed and nodded as if she understood. Dhani felt hungry. He headed towards the kitchen, with Binni skipping along beside him. His mother was fanning the chulha, filling up the room with smoke. “Amma, is Gandhiji going somewhere?” he asked. His mother coughed in the smoke and said, “They are going on a march.” “March? Where are they going?” Dhani queried. “Somewhere near the sea. Now stop asking questions and go away Dhani!” his mother said impatiently. “Let me finish the cooking first.” Dhani wandered off to the vegetable garden where old Binda was digging up potatoes.“Binda chacha,” Dhani sat beside him, “are you going on the march too?” Binda shook his head. Before he could say anything, Dhani eagerly asked, “Who is marching? Where are they going? What is happening?” Binda stopped digging and said, “I’ll answer all your questions, but first tie up that troublesome goat. She’s chewing up my spinach.” Dhani dragged Binni away and tied her to the lemon tree nearby. Then Binda told him about the march. Gandhiji and some of the men from the ashram were going to walk through Gujarat to reach the sea at a place called Dandi. They would walk through villages and towns for a whole month. Once they reached Dandi, they would make salt.“Salt?” Dhani sat up and frowned. “Why will they make salt? You can buy it in every shop!” “I know,” Binda laughed. “But Mahatmaji has a plan. You know he always marches to protest against something, right?” “Of course I know. He leads the Satyagraha marches to fight the British government and win freedom for India. But why is he protesting about salt? It’s silly!” “It’s not silly at all, Dhani! Do you know we all have to pay a tax on salt?” “So what?” “Everyone needs salt. . . that means, every Indian, even the poorest, has to pay this tax,” explained Binda chacha. “That is really unfair!” Dhani’s eyes were hot with anger.“Of course it’s unfair. Not only that, Indians are not allowed to make any salt either. Mahatmaji has asked the British to stop the tax, but they have refused. So he has decided to walk to Dandi and make salt from seawater.” “Walking for a month!” Dhani brooded worriedly. “Gandhiji will get really tired. Why don’t they take a bus or train to Dandi instead?” “Because, if he goes on this long march and walks all the way to Dandi, the news will spread. There will be pictures in the papers and reports on the radio, and people all over the world will know that we are fighting for our freedom. And that will really embarrass the British.” “Gandhiji is clever, isn’t he?” Dhani’s eyes were shining. “Ah, that he is!” Binda’s eyes crinkled with laughter. “He’s even written to the Viceroy and told him what he plans to do! The British have no idea what they are in for!”Later in the morning, Dhani wandered up to the hut where Gandhiji was staying and peered in through a window. Inside, many of the ashram people were talking to Gandhiji. Dhani heard them planning the route along which they would walk to Dandi. He was thrilled to see his father sitting among the people. In the afternoon, when the ashram was quiet, Dhani went looking for his father. He found him under a tree, spinning on his charkha. “Pitaji, are you and Amma going on the march to Dandi?” Dhani got straight to the point. “I am going. You and Amma will stay here.” “I am coming with you.” “Don’t be silly, Dhani. You can’t walk so much. Only the ashram’s young men will go.”“I’m nine and I can run faster than you can!” Dhani replied stubbornly. “You can’t stop me from coming with you.” His father stopped spinning and explained patiently, “Only the people who have been chosen by Mahatmaji will go.” “Fine! I’ll talk to him then! I’m sure he’ll say yes,” said Dhani and marched off. Gandhiji was a very busy man and it was not easy to catch him alone. But Dhani knew exactly when he would have the time to listen – early every morning when he went for a walk around the ashram. The next morning, as the sun came up, Dhani slipped out of bed and went looking for Gandhiji. He found him in the cowshed checking on all the cows. Then he strolled into the vegetable garden to inspect the peas and cabbage and have a chat with Binda.All the while, Dhani and Binni followed him. Finally, Gandhiji headed back to his hut. He sat down beside his charkha in the verandah and called out to Dhani, “Come here, child!” Dhani ran up, with Binni skipping along. “What’s your name beta?” “Dhani, Gandhiji.” “And this is your goat?” “Yes, Gandhiji! This is my friend Binni, who gives the milk you drink every morning.” Dhani smiled proudly and said, “I take care of her.” “Good!” Gandhiji leaned forward. “Now Dhani, tell me why you and Binni have been following me everywhere this morning?”“I wanted to ask you something,” Dhani began nervously. “Can I come with you to Dandi?” Gandhiji smiled, “You are too small, beta. Dandi is  kilometres away and only young men like your father will be able to walk with me.” “But you are not young!” Dhani said. “Won’t you feel tired?” “I am a very good walker,” Gandhiji replied. “I am a good walker too.” Dhani was adamant. “Ah yes,” Gandhiji looked thoughtful. “But there is a problem. If you go with me, who will take care of Binni? After walking for so long, I will become weak. When I come back, I’ll need to drink lots of milk to become strong again.”“Hmm, you’re right, Gandhiji. Binni eats only when I feed her.” Dhani lovingly stroked Binni’s head, “And only I know what she likes to eat.” “Exactly! So will you stay in the ashram and take care of Binni for me?” ""Yes, Gandhiji, I will,” said Dhani. “And Binni and I will be waiting for you.”Fun facts of History .

"Ramuramu was a very noisy goat. He would cry, ""Meeeeh, "" while others slept.One day, he kicked the gate to his pen and it opened. He fell down and looked up. He was free! There was a wonderful world out there to see!Alariwo, the little farm dog saw him. ""Woof! Woof! "" he barked. ""You cannot go! "" The goat head butted him.Ramuramu ran up the hill. He looked at the sky. ""Ehen! "" he cried. ""Now I am free! "" He felt like he could fly.He jumped and slid down the hill, laughing until he hit something. ""Gbam! "" He had landed next to Salewa, the cow.Ramuramu sniffed the grass and started to munch. Then he spat out the grass, wrinkling his face.Next, he saw chickens eating corn, and chased them around. Their feathers floated all over the place. The chickens cried, ""Cluck, cluck! ""Ramuramu stole a yam tuber from a pig. He ran very quickly with his loot!He soon found sweet grass with silly sheep. Ramuramu walked over and munched that grass.He heard a strange whistle that made the sheep gather and run. But Ramuramu lay down and started to sleep.He heard a wild, wild laugh that woke him up.

"In the grasslands of a National Park called Kaziranga, there lived a baby rhinoceros called Ringo. He was as strong as a baby rhino could be and lived with his mother and father.His brownishgrey hairless skin was knobby. He was very proud of his single horn made up of matted hair. Ringo was very shy and loved to wallow in the wet mud on the banks of the Brahmaputra which flows through the sanctuary.One hot afternoon, Ringo came to the river to drink water. This was the place where most animals came to drink water. There he saw gathered on the banks, a group of animals. There was Gajaraj, the elephant, Natkhat, the langur, Hemu, the swamp deer, Kalia, the crow, Nelu, the Indian Bison, Harini, the black necked stork along with Bhanu and Hari, the two frogs.Gajaraj, the elephant was the first to spot Ringo. “HELLO!” He trumpeted. “I am Gajaraj the elephant and these are my friends.” Ringo very shyly looked at them all. “What is your name?” Natkhat, the langur asked. Ringo looked around and took a step back. “I am RHIN…Rhin…” Just then a fly sat on his nose and Ringo sneezed.Natkhat giggled and jumped on to the branch of the tree which had spread itself above the water. “He, he, he…Rhin…Rhin.” They all thought that he was just “Rhin.” Hemu, the deer looked at Ringo, turned up her nose and bent down to drink water.Bhanu and Hari swam deep down into the water and bobbed up and down every few minutes. And Harini did not look at Ringo. Kalia cawed loudly. “So, you are Rhin. What a strange name.” Ringo looked at them. He snorted. “Rhin, Rhin…Hehehe…” Natkhat chattered.Ringo, the rhino stepped back and charged. His head bent, he snorted and charged. His short, strong legs ran so fast that he did not stop. He was very angry. How could he be so silly and shy that he could not tell them his name? He ran and ran through the tall grass along the bank.He passed herds of deer grazing on tender grass. The field mice, the wild rabbit and the eagle… he ran past all of them. Suddenly he found himself on the main highway which ran close to the National Park.He stood in the middle of the highway. ""How could I be so shy and not be able to say my name? I must practice hard. "" He snorted and grunted and started. . . ""RHIN, RHIN, RHIN. . . "" He got stuck again. ""This will not do. . . , "" he said to himself. Suddenly, there was honking. The buses, cars and trucks stopped.What was this rhino doing in the middle of the highway? ""Honk. . . honk. . . "" Ringo felt scared. He turned and charged back again down the slope, across the open land. He charged. . . as fast as his legs took him.He ran and ran till he reached the tall grass and he said to himself, “Rhino… Rhino… Rhino…Rhino…” The eagle had flown high up in the sky and with his sharp, beady eyes, he spotted Ringo practicing very hard to say his name, loud and clear. The field mice also watched and so did the rabbit.They did not make fun. “Rhino… Ring… Rhinos… RHINOCEROS… I am Ringo, the RHINOCEROS… RINGO, the RHINOCEROS.” At last, Ringo did not feel shy… he looked at the field mice and said, “I am Ringo, the Rhinoceros.”He went back to the same place where all the animals came to drink the cool water from the Brahmaputra. Soon, Gajaraj came followed by Neelu, Hemu, Natkhat, Kalia, and Harini. Bhanu and Hari were already there. The field mice, wild rabbit and the eagle joined them. Ringo looked at them.Slowly and surely he said loud and clear, “I am RINGO, the RHINOCEROS.” He could not imagine that he could say his name so clearly. Gajaraj said, “Hello RINGO… Rhinoceros.” The eagle said, “He has worked hard to say his name. We must not make fun of others.” Gajaraj looked at Natkhat. “No making fun.” Natkhat said, “Let’s be friends, Ringo Rhinoceros.”“This National Park is for all animals.” Gajaraj trumpeted loudly. “We must live in harmony and not make fun of others.” All the other animals said “Hello, Ringo… Rhinoceros.” Ringo was very happy. He had learnt to say his name and was no longer shy and had made so many new friends."	./Story text files/502.txt	4024	17	5.626477541371158	355	68	239	42.27956989247312	58	35	46	8.956989247311828	55	38	241	182	4	1.3907815631262526	446	53
"It was a good morning and the little wheels were excited. They had been waiting and waiting for their first run, and today was the day! Last night, they had been brought home from the shop for Shazia. They were bright red, and each had two little ghungroos at the centre. Shazia's sister had put them there last night. Shazia loved the sound of ghunghroos even though she hated dancing — or at least dancing the way the teacher told her to.The new bicycle was her big surprise as she was turning six today. It had two little trainer wheels. And the little wheels could not wait to be on the road. They hadn’t even seen a road yet!But they had heard plenty about it. The older bikes in the shop had gone on and on about the traffic, the dust, the noise, the gravel, the pain, the honking, the pits, and how hard and tiring and grown up it was to be on the road. The tiny wheelies weren’t put off by any of this. For them, the road was full of adventure – Shazia would race in and out of the lanes, and they would roll and roll, and make merry tinkling sounds with each roll, and never let her fall.So while they waited and giggled, they also sang, ""We are the wheelies, the wheelywheely wheelies  The onlywonly wheelies, of the whole wide world. "" They had been hushed and they had been shushed, but they did not stop. So it was no surprise that after the fiftyninth time, everyone around them, including the bigger wheels of the bike, turned to them and said in one voice, ""Enough! """"Meeep, "" they said in surprise and looked about. ""All of us have wheels working somewhere, "" the fan in the room said, ""so do stop with this onlywonly nonsense. """"And with that awful tune! "" said the bell, who was feeling a bit unhappy about not being the only soundmaking thing on the cycle. ""You don’t have wheels, "" the little ones said to the fan, ""and neither do you, "" to the bell. ""That is what you think! "" said the fan. ""My motor has wheels and my blades move because of electricity which is produced with the help of wheels, BIGBIG wheels, and lots of them. """"And I go tring tring because of little wheels inside me that produce the sound, "" said the bell.""We were made with machines that cannot work without wheels, "" said the tubelight from the wall.""And I would not be there to eat if the wheels of the millstone did not grind the wheat, "" said the rotis from the dabba on the table.""Hey, who would get watered without the water wheels then? "" asked the lime pickle. ""None of us! "" the mango chutney replied.And the big wheels of the cycle said, ""This cycle only would not have been made. """"And I would just be a fancy needle without wheels, "" the sewing machine said from its corner.The little wheels went quiet. A few minutes later, they started another song. ""We are the wheelies, the wheelywheely wheelies  The wonderful wheelies, that run the whole wide world. "" Slowly, everyone joined in the singing.Little sleepy Shazia thought she heard some singing. She jumped out of bed and woke everyone else up too. It was her birthday after all, so she got to do what she wanted. And soon the little wheelies, the big wheels, the whole cycle, Shazia on the cycle and her sister running behind her, all came out to the lane and started running on the gravel.The wheels were going on to the road!Wheels are everywhere! When you look around, you’ll see that wheels are all around us. Make a list of things in which wheels are used – at home, in your school, on the streets. Above are a few just to get you started. Ask your parents and teachers to add to your list."	./Story text files/254.txt	3557	14	5.536723163841808	299	55	194	71.61224489795919	18	31	42	14.571428571428571	15	34	230	124	5	1.3341902313624678	366	23
Late one night, when her Amma and Achan are fast asleep, Maisha grabs her goggles and sneaks out of the house. Maisha loves the beach at night. And one of her best friends lives in the sea.Maisha goes to their usual meeting place on the beach and calls out. “Uchli! Are you here?” She can sit here for hours, watching Uchli fly in and out of the water. Uchli is a flying fish and loves to show off his tricks.But today, Uchli looks worried. “What’s the matter?” Maisha asks. “Why do you look so upset?” “Can’t you see?” he says. “The moon is missing!”The moon! Uchli is right—their friend is not in the sky tonight. In fact, there’s a big hole where the moon should have been. “But we saw her just last night!” Maisha exclaims. “She rose from the sea right here in front of us. . . Do you think she’s lost underwater?” “We have to find her!” Uchli says.“But how will we see anything without moonlight?” Maisha asks. Just then, Uchli notices something in the water. Every time a wave breaks in the distance, little sparks of light glow and fade and glow again.“Maisha!” he shouts, excited. “I have an idea! Get on my back, let’s go to those waves over there!” When they reach the lights, Maisha puts on her goggles, holds onto Uchli tightly and . . .Maisha gasps. She feels like she’s floating in a sky full of stars! There are tiny creatures glowing all around her. “Wow, who are they?” she whispers to Uchli.“They’re plankton. Maybe they can help us light our way in the sea!” Uchli says. “Will you share your light with us?” Maisha asks one of them. “The moon is missing, and we need some light to find her.” “You will need more than just my light,” the plankter says. “Let me ask my friends if they can help too!” Soon, Maisha and Uchli are joined by an army of little animals and their flickering lights. “Now where can the moon be?” Maisha wonders.“I can help you,” a deep, booming voice says near Maisha's ear. She spins around. The eight tentacles of a firefly squid glimmer back at her. His body is covered in neon blue lights. “I saw the moon go this way just a little while ago.” At first, Maisha is scared of the big tentacles. But she knows the firefly squid’s light can help them see better underwater.“Lead the way,” Maisha says. The squid wraps one of his tentacles around Maisha's finger. “Hold on tight!”Then Maisha, Uchli, the glowing plankton, and the firefly squid all swim down together. Down, down, down they go where the water is very dark. But the plankton glow brighter, and the squid flashes his light. There is still no moon in sight. Then they meet an anglerfish, out on a hunt. She has big teeth, but Maisha is not scared anymore.“Hello,” she says. “We’re looking for the moon. Have you seen her around?” “Yes!” says the anglerfish. “I saw her swimming with some moonfish a few hours ago. Follow me!”Maisha, Uchli, the squid, and the plankton follow the green lure of the anglerfish. The light from the glowing animals falls like a spotlight on the dark ocean floor.Suddenly, Maisha sees something white under a rock. It’s the moon! “Help!” squeaks the moon. “I’m stuck!” The squid lifts the rock with his tentacles. “Hurrah!” everyone shouts, as the pale moon slips out.“What happened?” Uchli asks. “I came here to meet my cousins, the moonfish,” says the moon. “I got lost on my way back when my light began to fade. And then I got stuck under this rock. Thank you for coming to look for me.”“So this is where you are when you’re not in the sky!” Maisha says. The moon smiles and begins to float up towards the surface. Finally, she jumps into the sky.Uchli and Maisha wave goodbye to their new friends and swim back to the beach in the moonlight. The stars under the sea continue to shine deep into the night.MEET THE LIGHTMAKERS Did you know that many animals, both above and under water, are able to make their own light?The tiny plankton that Maisha and Uchli meet glow to scare the animals that might eat them. When they sense movement in the water, the plankton let out bright sparks as a warning. Sometimes, waves and boat traffic also trigger this light. While planktonic animals have a chemical in them that helps them glow, the firefly squid has special organs called photophores that produce its light. Thousands of these lightproducing photophores on the squid’s body flash to attract food, or impress a mate, or confuse predators.The lures of anglerfish get their light from the glowing bacteria that live inside them. Many plants and animals glow above the water too. Fireflies, some mushrooms, and even you emit a tiny amount of light every day!	./Story text files/497.txt	4591	16	5.74012474012474	399	82	150	41.51851851851852	68	40	25	8.62037037037037	55	53	289	192	4	1.3197879858657244	518	48

The twins Samar and Nivya are waiting for the school bus. “Do not turn around. He is staring at us!” Samar hisses at his sister Nivya.The Rakshas Sweetie Man is watching the children from his shop across the road. He is huge and scary! “His face is like a bulldog!” Samar says rudely. “His nose is like a samosa!” Nivya says. “And his fingers look like hairy bhindis!”The Rakshas SweetieMan may be scary, but he has the most fabulous sweet, toys and general shop – the Lovely Sweetie and Toy Shop.It has large piles of colourful sweets and chocolates. They see other children go into the shop but the twins are too scared to buy a single sweetie or toy from him.Once, they had seen heaps of a new chocolate in the shop. They decided to be brave, and went inside. “Pl…please, can we have that chocolate?” Samar mumbled.The Rakshas SweetieMan leaned across the counter, and reached out for them with his huge pythonlike arms. “Your teeth will fall out!” he grumbled softly.He took out a dreadful pair of false teeth from his cash drawer. He snapped it at the children. Samar and Nivya took one look and fled! “He was going to bite us with those teeth,” Nivya said trembling, once they were safely home. They never dared go back again.But today, Samar and Nivya see something even more scary. The Rakshas SweetieMan is holding a wriggling puppy close to his face and rumbling! Then he takes the puppy inside his shop and disappears. “Oh no! He is going to cook the puppy and eat her!” Nivya squeals.Samar and Nivya are sure that their own dog Lolo and her six new puppies are in danger. “We will not let the Rakshas SweetieMan cook you all,” says Nivya.But the next day, when Ma goes to the market, she leaves the gate open. Samar and Nivya watch in horror as all the six puppies run out – and straight into the Rakshas Sweetie Man’s shop! “He is going to eat them too, now!” Samar cries. “We have to rescue them!”Samar and Nivya hold hands and slowly walk into the dark cave of the shop. No one is there! At the back, a door is half open. Trembling, they push it open.The Rakshas SweetieMan looks at the children and beams. “Look,” he rumbles, “they are not afraid!”	./Story text files/107.txt	2164	13	5.626609442060086	192	41	129	46.06521739130435	28	18	24	9.565217391304348	23	23	137	96	4	1.3878326996197718	244	19

"“Foooo! Foooo!” Anna Mani blew out all eight candles on her birthday cake. ""Happy birthday, Anna! "" shouted her brothers and sisters. Anna had a big family and a big house on a hill. But on her birthday, she had only one small wish.Anna tore open her birthday gift and peered in. There was something sparkling inside. “Diamond earrings? Aiyye!” She did not want diamond earrings. They were expensive and useless! Do you know what Anna really wished for? Books, books and more books!“We have books at home!” said her brother. But Anna had already read those. “There are more in the library,” pointed out her grandfather. But Anna had read those too! She marched into her room. “Hmmph!”Later that day, there was a knock on Anna’s door. But there was nobody outside! Instead, there lay a big box at her doorstep. “This better not be more jewellery!” she said loudly. It wasn’t. It was a brand new Encyclopaedia set! “So many books. Hurray!” Anna ran around her house, hugging everyone.Many years, and many, many, many books later, Anna found a job in the laboratory of a famous scientist. “What should I do here?” asked Anna. The scientist pointed to a box. What do you think she found inside?“Diamonds? Aiyyyye!” said Anna. But this time, the diamonds were not to be worn. They were for experiments. The scientist wanted Anna to find out what makes diamonds shine. So she read books about diamonds. Books, books and more books!Being a scientist was the best! Anna could study anything she wanted. She did like things that shine. And what shines brighter than diamonds? The sun! So Anna read books about the sun, sunlight and weather. Books, books and more books!Anna did hundreds of experiments. She built many gadgets to measure the weather of a place.How sunny is it in Bombay? Anna built a gadget to measure that. How windy is it in Madras? Anna built a gadget for that too.Her favourite gadget took many months to build. It was a special balloon called ozonesonde. It had a small machine fixed to it. The machine measured a gas found in the air called ozone. Ozonesondes fly really high. Look, there goes Anna’s ozonesonde!Guess how many gadgets Anna Mani built in all? Nearly one hundred weather gadgets! She even had her own factory to make these gadgets. It was as if she could build anything!Anna Mani became one of the wisest weather scientists in India. Even as she grew older and more wellknown, her best friends remained the same. Books, books and more books!Life & Times of Anna: A Timeline  August,   Anna Mani is born in Peermedu in Kerala.   She gets a scholarship to work at CV Raman’s laboratory in Bangalore.   She leaves for England to study meteorology.   She returns and joins the Indian Meteorological Department in Pune.  She starts work on the ozonesonde project.   She retires as Deputy Director General of the Indian Meteorological department. In the s (exact year unknown)  She starts her own company to manufacture her gadgets.  August,   Anna Mani passes away in Kerala.Wonderful Weather Words Meteorologist (say it like this: ‘meetyourall ojist’): A meteorologist is a scientist who studies the weather and climate of a region. Anna Mani was one of the best meteorologists there ever was. Ozonesonde (say it like this: ‘ohzonesond’): Ozonesondes are balloons that fly high up into the sky. The balloons have gadgets fixed to them that measure the amount of ozone present in the air. Ozone is important because it blocks out harmful light coming from the sun. Too little ozone high up in the sky means we are in trouble! If you could be a scientist, what would you want to study?A Note on the Book This story is a work of creative nonfiction based on the life of Anna Mani."	./Story text files/374.txt	3701	17	6.2710027100271	277	92	157	41.06818181818182	65	23	24	8.420454545454545	52	36	184	185	6	1.49890590809628	405	52
"“A perfect day for a walk!” thinks Mr. Centipede. “What better way to keep my  feet strong and fit?” At the end of each foot, Mr. Centipede wears a bold, bright, beautiful, boot. That is  pairs of boots for all  feet!Whom does he first meet, but Dame Damsel Fly? ""What big boots you have on, "" she says. ""Tell me, Mr. Centipede, which leg do you place before which, when you go walking? "" ""Why this leg of course!” says Mr. Centipede, lifting leg number . ""Wait! Actually, this leg!” He lifts leg number .“Such fine boots!” says the Big Beetle. “Tell me, Mr. Centipede, which leg do you place before which, when you go walking?”“What a silly question,” says Mr. Centipede annoyed. He sticks out leg number . And puts it down quickly. He sticks out leg number  instead.“What is happening here?” asks Elder Ant. “Shhh! Poor Mr. Centipede is very confused,” whispers Dame Damsel Fly. “In all this time, even though he has so many boots, he has been unable to take a single step.”“Is that so?” says Elder Ant with a sigh. ""Tell me, Mr. Centipede, which leg do you place before which, when you go for a walk. ""“I start simply with this one…” says Mr. Centipede, lifting leg number . “Oh nooo! I mean… that one.” He lifts leg number . “Oh noooo! None of them. I mean, one of them. Oh nooo! I have forgotten what I mean!”“Run, run quickly!” they hear a voice. “Who is that?” cries Big Beetle. “I am Stick Insect. You, with all those boots, had better run.”“I have spotted a blackbird,” whispers Stick Insect. “She seems quite hungry and ready for breakfast. She cannot see me because I look like the tree bark I am resting on. But she sure can see you, dressed up in those big bright colourful boots! Run, run quickly!” “HAHAHA!” The Stick Insect laughs. “What is so funny?” asks Lady Spider, who just swung by for a visit.“There was no blackbird!” says Stick Insect. “It was just a trick to have some fun. And make all those boots run! You will agree, now that it is done Mr. Centipede sure can run!”Isn't it funny that Mr Centipede was finding it difficult to take a single step but had no trouble running? This could happen to any of us! There are things we do every day without realising – like blinking, or moving our hands while talking. But if we pay careful attention to how often we blink or in what way our hands move, we may get confused. This is called the Centipede's Dilemma or Humphrey's Law."	./Story text files/303.txt	2400	14	5.370909090909091	229	46	107	31.89041095890411	61	12	23	7.109589041095891	52	21	154	121	4	1.180232558139535	318	26
"My Nani, like all other Nanis, used to tell me very interesting stories. Many wonderful tales from India, Arabia, Iran and Turan. Although many of her stories have escaped my memory, some of them are still fresh in my mind. I am reminded of one of these beautiful stories today, named naseehat which means ‘advice’.Many years ago in a small town in Egypt, there lived a man named Abdullah bin Saad. Abdullah worked with camels. He had the most pedigreed camels of the finest quality with fur as white as a rabbit's. Abdullah loved his camels like they were his own children.Once a year, he would sell them at the cattle fair and earn a good sum of money. Then he would rear the new and the remaining camels and increase his herd. Abdullah had a good, honest wife and three sons who lived happily in his hut. The camel enclosure was right outside the hut. It was a sight to see many of his handsome white camels chewing their cud under the leafy date trees in the enclosure. As time passed, Abdullah and his wife gradually grew weak and old.One night at dinner time, Abdullah bin Saad said to his three sons, “My boys, I am getting old now and my body is getting weaker every day. I’m sick so often, I feel that soon my time will come. When I’m gone, look after your mother and please don’t fight amongst yourselves. I don’t have much, but I have written a will which you can find in a pot in the granary.” One morning soon after, Abdullah was found lifeless in his bed by his wife and sons. The third day after Abdullah’s death, when his family could stop crying, they thought of his will. His sons searched every pot in the granary and finally found a paper wrapped in plastic. On opening the seal they found that it was not a will but a directive through which Abdullah bin Saad had addressed them.“My children, I ask that the three of you look after your mother. Tell her about your decisions; if you travel anywhere, inform her before leaving. Ahmad, you are the eldest, so you will have the most responsibility. You will have to take care of your younger brothers, Muhammad and Mukarram. Ahmad, as the eldest, you must be present for any wedding, death or any other event in the house. Muhammad, since you are in the middle, you must respect your elder brother and indulge your younger one. You should also respect and love your mother. Mukarram, you are the youngest and the closest to your mother, so you must ensure that every need of your mother’s is fulfilled either by you or by your brothers. You must respect your brothers because after me, they will be your elders.”The sons read the page from top to bottom and looked at each other, horrified that their father had left not a vasiyat or will, but a naseehat or advice, for them. Then, Rukaiya, Abdullah’s wife said that she remembered that her husband had written on two sheets of paper that night, but they had read only one. She told them to check if the second page was stuck to the first one. When Ahmad rubbed the corner of the paper, he found that there really was another paper stuck to the first one. The sons’ faces lit up. Ahmad, the eldest said, “Thank God! Abba has written his will on this one!” Muhammad and Mukarram said, “Read it quickly, quickly!” Ahmad began to read.“With Allah as my witness, I write that after my death my house goes to my wife, Rukaiya Khatoon, and it is up to her to keep it, give it to our sons or sell it. The decision rests with my wife. Apart from my house I have no other property. However, after my death, my camels will be distributed between my wife and children. The healthiest and most handsome camel will go to my wife. The remainder will be divided between my sons. Ahmad will get half of the remaining camels after my wife has taken one. Muhammad will get onethird of the camels and Mukarram will get oneninth.” Abdullah bin Saad had eighteen camels when he died. The best camel would go to Rukaiya Khatoon. There remained seventeen beasts.Ahmad demanded his half, but he could not have half of seventeen camels, that is eightandahalf camels. No one knew where to get half a camel from. Similarly, when Muhammad asked for onethird and Mukarram for oneninth, it proved impossible to divide the camels. The three brothers began quarrelling, each wanting his entire share of the animals. None of them was willing to back down. Their mother exclaimed that their father was hardly buried, and they were already enemies with each other.Mukkaram, the youngest, saw that their fighting had made his mother sad. He thought of his father's words in his naseehat. “Ammi, you are wise. Why don't you tell us what we should do?” he said. Remembering the naseehat, Muhammad decided to indulge his younger brother. “Yes, Ammi, what do you suggest?” Ahmad realized too, that his father would want him to respect his mother's wish first. “Tell us Ammi, what is your wish?” he asked. The mother thought for some time. Then she said, “Let me add my camel to your camels. So how many camels do you have now?”""Eighteen, "" said the boys. Ammi said, ""Absolutely correct. Ahmad you are the eldest, and according to the will you are given half the camels. You have nine of them. Muhammad, according to the will you get one third of the camels, so you have one third of eighteen, that is, six. And Mukarram, according to your father’s will you are given one ninth of the camels. One ninth of eighteen is two camels.” Ammi said that the matter was now settled. Ahmad said, “Yes Ammi. I get nine, Muhammad gets six and Mukarram gets two. My God! Together these come to seventeen camels, so your camel will stay with you!”Ammi smiled. She said, “Your father was a just and honest man.”"	./Story text files/448.txt	5673	15	5.900369003690037	417	125	163	65.75294117647059	33	52	36	13.094117647058823	20	65	288	254	6	1.5571895424836601	515	97
Druvi the dragonfly has just learnt to fly. She flies near the pond with her friends. They tease the frogs and eat mosquitoes for lunch.In the evening, Druvi flies to the jungle nearby. She looks at the bird nests and spider webs. She does not see the clouds gather in the sky.Plop! A raindrop falls on Druvi’s head. Druvi wants to go back home. But she does not want her wings to get wet.“I need an umbrella,” thinks Druvi. She flies to the Gulmohar tree. It looks like a strong, red umbrella.The leaves are too tiny. “Too small to even cover an ant,” thinks Druvi. “I need something bigger.”Druvi sees big, starshaped leaves. “The Papaya tree leaves would make a lovely umbrella,” thinks Druvi. “Oh no, it is letting all the rain in.”The wind blows strong but Druvi has still not found her umbrella. She perches under a plant but the thin leaves fold up! “How unkind you are,” Druvi says to the TouchMeNot plant.Druvi is upset. The jungle is full of leaves. There are thin leaves and fat ones, big ones and small ones. But none are umbrella leaves.Suddenly Druvi sees a Banyan tree. It does not have starshaped leaves or prickly leaves. The leaves are not too heavy or too small.Druvi flies towards the Banyan tree. She perches under the leaf. She has found her umbrella!More about dragonflies Dragonflies are great travellers! Some dragonflies – like the Wandering Glider that we find in our fields and gardens – travel across the open seas from India to Africa. They travel more than ,  kilometres to cross the Indian Ocean. They start their journey from India in October and reach countries like Tanzania in January. On the way, they stop at islands like the Maldives and Seychelles. Dragonflies cannot fly if they are too hot or too cold. In the morning, they spread their wings to get heat from the sun. In the afternoon, some dragonflies perch with their body raised and their stomach pointing to the sun, to stay cool.	./Story text files/479.txt	1927	15	5.874371859296482	161	38	135	46.02439024390244	26	15	26	9.317073170731707	19	22	133	66	4	1.4127659574468086	204	31
"Papa took Pattu’s report card from Ms Anuradha like it was a big box of sweets – with a big smile to match.Last time, Pattu had made a paper plane out of his report card. He said he sent it flying home – it never got there. Wonder why?Maybe the sparrow in the tree could tell you what a warm nest it made. Or the peanut seller could tell you what a nice cone it made.So this time, Papa went with Pattu to get his report card from the teacher himself. Papa looked at Pattu’s report card. His smile went from a slice of papaya to the thin wedge of a lime. out of  for Reading. Papa’s eyebrows dashed together like colliding bulls.  out of  for Recitation. He shook his head from side to side, like a tree in a storm.  out of  for Spelling. He let out a long whoosh, which sounded like a train engine.As they walked home, Papa thought, “This report card needs to be made not into a paper plane, but into a rocket and launched far, far away. What will Pattu’s Mummy say? She always used to come first in her class.”Just then, Pattu’s friend Shambavi came running and gave Pattu a toffee. “This is for sharing your pencils with me yesterday, when I forgot to bring one,” said Shambavi. “No wonder Pattu comes home with no pencils,” thought Papa.On the way home, a bunch of dogs ran alongside them, wagging their tails happily. Pattu bent down and patted their heads. “I. . . er. . . I give Kalu, Chintu and Bintu a few puris from my lunchbox,” he said. “And your mummy is so happy you are asking for extra puris,” thought Papa, “If only she knew where they disappeared!”Pattu and Papa were almost home, when their neighbour Das Uncle called out from his garden, ""Hello Pattu, I don’t need medicines today. "" Papa wondered, “We don’t need medicines as well. Why is he talking about medicines?” Das Uncle said, “I ask your son to buy medicines from the corner shop for me. He always brings back exact change. You must be proud of him.”At home, Mummy came out and asked, “How is Pattu’s report card?” Papa closed his eyes, and said, “It was a big, big shock!” Pattu’s face was as small as a crushed grape.“ out of  for sharing,” said Papa. “ out of  for kindness.  out of  for respect.”Pattu’s face was like an orange and Mummy’s like a watermelon – both bright and full of joy.Mummy sat down with Pattu. “This is my real report card,” Pattu said. Mummy smiled. “ out of  for honesty. No one could get a better report card.”"	./Story text files/50.txt	2416	18	5.3610108303249095	243	34	138	47.34	27	23	27	10.24	24	26	175	102	4	1.3140243902439024	311	17
Mela Shobhini asked Nani, “Shall we go to the mela?” From a distance they could see the big giant wheel. It turned slowly and then faster and faster. “Shall we take a ride on the giant wheel?” Shobhini said to Nani. The wheel began to move slowly. Then it began to go faster and faster. Shobhini closed her eyes tightly. She was not really scared but felt better when she held on to Nani’s hand. She would open her eyes a little from time to time to see where they were. Shobhini noticed that Nani did not shut her eyes. Instead she was laughing and waving to the people below. When the ride was over, Shobhini and Nani wandered around in the mela. Shobhini bought a little horn. She tooted so hard that a dog jumped up and ran away.Nani bought Shobhini a gas balloon. When they came home, Shobhini tied a small paper basket to the balloon and put some ants in the basket. Then she let go of the string. The balloon floated high above the house, beyond the field, past the mela and went off far, far away.Shobhini Combs Nani’s Hair Nani had just washed her hair. Her hair was long, soft and white and it was shining in the sunshine. “Nani, can I comb your hair for you?” asked Shobhini. “I will do it carefully. I won’t hurt you at all.” Shobhini combed Nani’s hair carefully. She made a parting in the middle and divided her hair into two parts. With each portion she made a pony tail on either side of Nani’s head. Not happy with the pony tails, she made them into two long plaits. Quickly Shobhini found a big yellow flower. She stuck the flower in one of Nani’s plaits. A red and orange butterfly came and sat down on Nani’s hair. Right next to the big yellow flower. Shobhini ran to bring a mirror. She showed Nani the two long plaits, the big yellow flower and the colourful butterfly.Jungle “Shall we go to the jungle?” Shobhini asked Nani. “There are wild animals there. You won’t be scared, I hope?” Shobhini and Nani reached the jungle. First they saw a rabbit. He was lost and was looking for his mother. His eyes were full of tears. Shobhini and Nani helped him find his mother. Elephants were bathing in the river. They filled water in their trunks and sprayed it like a fountain over each other. It looked like a lot of fun. One monkey was eating a mango on a tree. Shobhini teased the monkey and made a face at him. The monkey was furious. He took a mango and threw it at Shobhini. Nani quickly put her hand out and swiftly caught the mango before it could hit Shobhini. It was a very good catch. “Wow ! Nani ! !” said Shobhini. “I did not know that you could play cricket!”Rain It was raining. Sometimes it was windy and the rain came pouring down hard and loud. Sometimes the rain was soft. Shobhini asked Nani, “Can I go out and play in the rain? I want to get wet.” “Be careful of the lightning,” replied Nani. Shobhini’s dog Pillu was under the chair. When he saw Shobhini with an umbrella, he came out from under the chair. Pillu licked Shobhini’s hand and wagged his tail. “All right,” said Shobhini “You can come too.” Shobhini walked ahead. Pillu was just behind her. As they reached the end of the verandah, there was a sudden gust of wind. Shobhini’s umbrella flew out of her hand and out onto the grass. There was a streak of lightning in the sky. Shobhini stopped.A few seconds later, there was a very loud clap of thunder. Pillu ran back to the house and hid under the chair. Shobhini ran back and hid in Nani’s lap.Wool Nani was sitting in the sun. She was rolling wool into a ball. “Can I help you?” asked Shobhini. Shobhini looked for the end of the wool. She started rolling it into a ball like Nani was doing. Soon the wool became a big ball. When it was too big, it slipped out of Shobhini’s hand and jumped up in the air. Many swans were flying overhead. One of them caught the ball of wool. Shobhini looked up and saw a long string of red wool hanging from the sky. Shobhini clapped her hands when she saw this sight. The other end of the wool slipped out of her hands. When the swan heard the clap he looked down. He could see Shobhini on the ground but she looked very small from so high up.As he looked, the ball of wool slipped out of his mouth. Shobhini ran to where the wool fell from the sky. She quickly rolled up all the wool and gave the ball to Nani.The River It was a hot summer day. “Nani, will you come with me to the river to bathe?” asked Shobhini. The river was quite far from the house. Nani and Shobhini sat in a tonga and reached the riverbank. Many people were bathing on the ghats. The water near the banks did not flow very fast. Shobhini had brought many paper boats with her. One of her boats quickly floated away very far. Nani talked to a boatman. Shobhini and Nani sat in the boat and went quite far. The boatman said, “The water is very deep here. If you put one elephant on top of another, they would both sink.” ‘Wow! One elephant on top of another, ’ thought Shobhini, entranced. A goldfish leapt out of the water. It touched Shobhini’s hand. Shobhini was delighted.The boatman said, “Come again, Shobhini.” “You know me?” asked Shobhini surprised. “Yes, I know your mother too,” said the boatman, “When she was little, I used to take her out on this boat.” Nani smiled at Shobhini.The Moon “Let us go to the moon today,” said Shobhini to Nani. She took Nani’s special walking stick – the one that had a head of silver. First Shobhini climbed on the stick. “Get on carefully, Nani,” said Shobhini. “There is nothing to be scared of.”The stick zoomed into the air with Shobhini sitting on the stick and Nani behind her. They flew into the sky, above all the birds and the clouds. Soon they were like tiny dots in the sky. We are all waiting for them to come back. . .	./Story text files/365.txt	5735	16	5.452188006482982	525	92	107	43.12307692307692	86	44	23	9.315384615384616	60	70	430	187	4	1.3526970954356847	647	76
Amma is visiting Nani. Tara and Mini are waiting for her. ‘What will she bring back this time? ’ they wonder.The street is flooded with water. Tara and Mini can’t wait to float their boats!Honk! Honk! A taxi stops at the corner. Amma is back. “When did you get a boat?” she asks. “When the street got flooded with water,” Mini says.“And how did the street get flooded with water?” Amma asks. “Because there wasn’t enough place for the water in our house,” says Tara.“Why didn’t you use buckets to hold the water?” Amma asks. “How could we? The water was rushing and gushing out of the pipe!” says Mini. “It was splashing and washing the floor,” adds Tara.“The pipe! How did it break?” Amma asks. “CRACK!” says Mini. “When Baba hit it to get the tap working properly,” says Tara.“The water went crashing and falling down the stairs!” says Mini. “It flowed out of the house and flooded the street.”Amma races into the house, and bursts into the bathroom. The house is ringing with the sound of water rushing and gushing.Amma opens her toolkit. There are many things in there  a hammer, a wrench, screwdrivers, and a tape.Amma twists and turns things. She knocks and mends. Finally, there is silence. The rushing sound of water stops.Mini and Tara ask, “What did you bring us?” Amma has brought them toolkits. “These are just like yours, Amma,” says Mini.“What can we do with this?” Tara asks. “Anything,” Amma smiles. “You can fix your bicycle, make a rocket fly or. . . stop the water rushing and gushing and flooding the street!”	./Story text files/105.txt	1529	13	5.730538922155689	139	28	77	29.6	39	11	16	6.4	33	17	98	69	3	1.2688679245283019	206	6
Aman was sure he heard it. BOINK BOINK BOINK! He was standing near the Samrat Yantra, the world's largest sundial, at the Jantar Mantar Observatory in Jaipur. Close to where his cousin Razia stood, he could see something that looked like a gadget from which the sounds seemed to be coming. A small, squiggly object with what appeared like numbers and a meter and a needle that flickered wildly.“Razia, stop digging your nose,” he whispered to his little cousin. “And listen to that!” Razia turned around and looked at him with her big eyes, her nostrils flaring as she dug deeper. BOINK BOINK BOINKKKKK!Aman and his schoolmates were on an excursion from their school in Tonk. Jantar Mantar was built around  CE by Raja Sawai Jai Singh. It is a treasure house of instruments designed to measure time and observe the movement of heavenly bodies.But what Aman saw now was an inky blue gadget flying in front of him. He wanted to catch it and see what it was. Frrrrrrrrrr. . . . . . . . off the gadget flew. Flying over the beautiful lawn around the Chakra Yantra, flying around the smart Jai Prakash Yantra, flying fast over the freshly polished Dhruva Yantra, it flew slowly around to where. . . OH NO! The device seemed to hover over the heads of the Terrible Four, the bullies of Class , Tonk Vidyalaya. The Terrible Four were just going to have a match to see who could spit out saliva the farthest against a wall of the Samrat Yantra.Aman was usually scared of these four boys, but today he just did not pay any attention to them. Instead, he jumped up and tried to catch the inky blue object.The bullies started laughing at him loudly. “Eeks! Please ask them to stop laughing,” said a strange voice. “STOP LAUGHING!” shouted Aman, hardly believing that he was doing it. “Ohhh and please ask them not to spit. . . . EEEE. . . my eyes are getting a headache!” said the pained voice. “AND STOP SPITTING, MY EYES ARE GETTING A HEADACHE!” repeated Aman. Actually Aman's head was having a headache. BOINK BOINK BOINK went the sound loudly in his head just then, and then there was silence. . .The boys looked strangely at Aman. Razia looked at Aman strangely. Pema Gurung who had joined their school last year smiled slightly. “Aman, are you seeing and hearing. . .” Before she could finish saying whatever she wanted to, Razia pulled her away. “Pema, I HAVE to GO! Come with me please.”Aman felt very strange. The sun dials and other structures looked wonderful. He thought of the king who had invented these instruments to make calculations about how far were stars and planets. How could someone measure something like the position of the Pole Star in the sky? Or the exact time of the day? So, so many years ago before the invention of digital watches? Aman loved to tinker with gadgets and machines to see how they worked, what they did, what they were made of. And as he wondered about Jantar Mantar, he heard it again. Softly at first. Louder and louder it grew, until it seemed to be right next to him. BOINK BOINK BOINK!“Bhaiya, stop dreaming! Look at those men. . . . I can't tell them to. . . . they are going to. . .” Pema was giggling, with her hands covering her face. Aman looked through the open gate of Jantar Mantar to see three men just about to squat by the roadside. BOINK BOINK BOINKKKKK!“STOP them please,” said the voice. “My nose gets a very bad headache when people use roads and public spaces instead of toilets!” “STOP! MY NOSE IS GETTING A HEADACHE!” shouted Aman. The men ran away, the girls giggled some more, and Aman felt a tap on his shoulder. Was it the ghost of Raja Sawai Jai Singh?“No, no, I'm not a ghost! I'm a Yontrik. From the planet Yontra. I came in my space shuttle Yontnik. I'm here on a trip, just like you are! Your planet is so lovely! But many places give me a headache. And when I get a headache, my meter starts making loud sounds. The dirtier a place, the louder the BOINKs! Please, may I ride on your shoulder for a while?” Aman was too stunned to say anything.The students were now moving in a line towards their bus taking them back to Tonk. When they had settled down inside the bus, a bhelpuri seller on the roadside splashed a bucket of dirty water on the bus. BOINK BOINK BOINK! went Yontrik's meter. “Ooh my ears! They have such a headache!” cried the Yontrik. “You know, I was here with other Yontriks when Raja Sawai Jai Singh built this place. We were so happy to see human beings making devices through which they could see our planet and other heavenly bodies. Now what has happened that they can't even keep their own surroundings clean?”Pema was looking at Aman carefully. “Do you have a headache?” she asked kindly. “Yes, me too,” he said. “Who else has a headache?”“There is a. . . a. . . creature. . . a thing. . . a. . . umm. . . whose ears have a headache. . .” “A Yontrik? I knew it! I have met a Yontrik in Gangtok who told me all about the Shuddh Yantra, the device that helps to keep his planet clean. And only after I met him did I understand why we must keep our city spic and span!” Razia was getting impatient with all this talk about Yontrik and Yontnik. She was also very upset that a bit of red paan spittle had flown from the driver's window and stuck to her shirt. Yuck! She bunched the empty packet of chips in her hand and threw it at the driver! “Oohhh, stop! Please stop people from throwing things! My hand is getting a headache!” cried Yontrik.“Razia, STOP LITTERING. My hand is getting a headache!” “What!” exclaimed the teacher. “Aman, what is this about your hand getting a headache?” asked Ranveer Sir.Aman gulped a few times. Then he squared his shoulders and started speaking. He could feel Yontrik at his shoulder, whispering something into his ears. “Sir, I have a friend who is allergic to all things unclean – paan splattered walls, smelly roadsides, littered parks, and dirty water splashed all around. He says every part of his body gets a headache when he sees them, or sees people doing things that they should not do in front of others! Like scratching one's private parts, or clearing phlegm from one's throat, loudly and spitting in public or using the pavement to. . . .”“That's enough, Aman!” said Ranveer Sir, with a laugh. The kids were howling with laughter. “And my friend also says, if we keep things clean, then the brain becomes free of headaches. And since clean places look so nice, we also feel much happier!”“Aman, that sounds crazy! But, it does make sense! Maybe you should invent a. . . a. . . yantra. . . a a. . . dirtometer! And use it to make the place good enough for your friend. You could get people to pay hefty fines if they defecate or urinate in public, spit or litter in public, or do anything disgraceful!” Aman felt a cool breeze near his ear. Instead of the BOINK BOINK, he heard a tingling tune, like from a wind chime. “That's a brilliant idea!” whispered Yontrik. “And brilliant ideas give me energy to zoom up to my world,” said Yontrik. “So bye, dear Aman, and good luck with your device!” Aman was too excited now to feel the loss of his new, secret friend, Yontrik. He had already started dreaming of making a meter, maybe something like the Shuddh Yantra!Yontrik says. . . • Spit or saliva is a useful liquid when it is inside our mouth. It contains an enzyme that helps in digestion, and keeps our gums healthy. But when it is outside of the body, it is dangerous. Diseases like Tuberculosis are spread through this. Splatters of saliva, paan or gutka also make places very ugly and unusable for others. If you need to spit to clear the phlegm out of your throats or blow your nose, do it in private, in a sink or bathroom and wash it down with as little water as possible. • Splashing dirty water in public places causes puddles in which mosquitoes can breed. All waste water should be emptied into drains.• Throwing plastic covers and other nondegradable trash in the open may clog open drains. This results in overflowing drains, or breakage of drain pipes. Sewage thus flows into the ground, contaminating the ground water. This contaminated water may get into the food chain, and cause people to fall sick. • Use a toilet before you leave your house or school so that you do not have the urge to urinate in public places. Smelly places become a breeding ground for germs. Defecating and urinating in public places makes them unclean, and leads to the spread of diseases such as diarrhoea, typhoid, and jaundice.	./Story text files/13.txt	8461	16	5.63855421686747	742	171	185	38.175925925925924	146	70	37	8.148148148148149	138	78	495	418	5	1.2924613987284288	1013	88
"It’s a big job, it’s number one priority and number two is pretty important too, because you can never ignore nature’s call. So when you gotta go, you gotta go! Some people can do this business inside their houses, some have to go outside. Some pour water after it’s done, others need not. It’s different in different parts of the world, just as it was different at different times in history.Toilets of the past A very long time ago, more than ,  years ago, the people of Indus Valley had beautiful houses with toilets built inside them. People could finish their business in privacy and pour a bucket of water which would flush the waste down a drain. This way, they managed to keep their houses and streets clean.The Indus Valley, situated in present day Pakistan and India, is one of the three oldest civilizations that we know of, the other two being Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. From what we can see of the ruins today, the people of Indus Valley had great building skills, were good at making metal and ceramic products, and planned their citywide drainage systems very elaborately.Around the same time, similar toilet arrangements were present in other parts of the world. Homes in Egypt and Babylonia had toilets built in, and the ruins in Skara Brae in Scotland and the Minoan Crete in the Mediterranean show plenty of pipes leading out of what definitely seems like a toilet inside a house. A little later, about ,  years ago in Rome, people used public toilets. A long slab of stone had keyholeshaped cuts at intervals. People would sit on these openings and do their toilet business while having a friendly chat with the person next to them. I told you it was a “public” toilet!How did they clean themselves, do you wonder? After I tell you, you might wish you had never wondered. They took a long stick that had a sponge attached to one end and dipped the sponge into water, and then used it to wipe their backsides. After they felt clean, they simply handed the stick over to their neighbour, who dipped it in water and used it again. Let me give you a friendly tip here – if you ever find yourself in this place, make sure you pick the very first seat!Not everyone had to poop in public in Rome. If you were superrich, you would have a chamber pot at home into which you would do your business. Once done, you would simply empty the contents onto the street outside. And if someone happened to walk by at the time, well, too bad for them! About  years ago, Queen Elizabeth of England had a toilet constructed inside her house. It had a pipe leading out into a sewage pit outside. But she never used it much because the stench from the sewer filled the toilet and she could not even breathe. So back to the chamber pot she went.Toilets of the present Toilets these days don’t stink. How did they achieve that? In , the English inventor Alexander Cumming figured out a way. Instead of using a straight pipe to connect the toilet to the sewage line, he made it Sshaped. This made sure that while poop and pee and water can go down the drain, no smell can come back up. Have you noticed that a little water always stays in the toilet even after flushing? This is what creates the ""seal"" and prevents the foul smell from entering the room through the drain.Just like olden times, different parts of the world today have different kinds of toilets. Some places don’t have toilets at all. Some toilets are made for sitting, some are made for squatting. Some have a bucket with water for flushing, others have a tank filled with water and a handle that releases the water. Some toilets have paper to wipe the backside, some have a tap or a bucket of water to wash up.There are some toilets that don’t use water at all. Like the ones on a plane. With all the turbulence, you certainly don’t want any water in the toilet bowl! The waste is removed by a powerful vacuum and stored in a tank below. After the plane lands, the waste is disposed of. There are also waterless toilets on the ground. They were designed and built for places without easy access to water, such as remote villages in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. They have been working well, so wouldn’t it be a good idea to have such toilets everywhere? Because the less water we use, and the less sewage we create, the better for the planet, right?Toilets of the future How do you make a waterless toilet? The first step is to make sure that you don’t let the urine and the faeces mix. No it’s not as gross as it sounds – it just needs the pot to be designed in a clever way. Like having a sloping bamboo mat act as a sieve that will allow the waste water to pass through, but can hold the poop and send it to a different pit.Since urine by itself is not harmful (it’s only the bacteria that collect on open urine that cause the smell and the hazard), it can be safely let into the ground or put to use. Here’s how: Hydrogen can be separated from the urine and used to fuel a generator. Urine also has nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium that are great ingredients for fertilizers. Now that urine is taken care of, what do we do with the solid waste? Well, if it is properly mixed with ash and grass, and allowed to rest in a pit, millions of bacteria will break it down into perfectly useful compost for agriculture.These toilets will help us build a world where there is no ""waste. "" Instead it is turned into something of use. If all houses in a city have such toilets, no sewage comes out of them, no expensive sewage treatment plants are necessary and no sewage will flow through the drains into lakes and rivers! What a great future for everyone!On pg  is a board game. You’ll need a few friends to play with and a die.

'Why don't I look like you Amma? ' Kavita asked her mother one day. 'You are lovely as you are Kavita! ' her mother replied. 'Why must you look like me? 'Because, ' said Kavita, 'Riya looks like her mother. And Payal looks like hers. ''Hmm. . why don't we go to the park? ' suggested Amma. 'I'll show you something there. ' 'No! insisted Kavita. 'Answer my question first. Why don't I look like you? ' 'The best answers are those you find for yourself! ' replied Amma. 'So, come with me. 'Kavita loved to play at the park and agreed to go. Some of Kavita's friends were at the park. But Amma walked past them all. Walking past the swings and the slides, Amma took Kavita to the far end of the park.There, Amma peered into the rows of neatly planted bushes and looked underneath the leaves. Kavita was puzzled. 'What are you doing Amma? ' she asked. 'Found it! ' Amma exclaimed. 'Found what? ' Kavita asked, still confused.'Look at this! ' Amma said pointing to a caterpillar munching away on a leaf. Kavita bent down to take a closer look. 'Those stripes look lovely! ' she exclaimed. 'Just like those of the tiger! she added. 'Indeed! ' said Amma. 'But this caterpillar is alone. Why don't we help her find her mother, ' she suggested.'Hmmm. . . Ok, ' responded Kavita, not sure why Amma was giving her this task. Kavita searched high and low. She crawled on the grass and she climbed on the trees. She searched inside shrubs and she looked underneath leaves.She found an army of ants marching in a line on the ground. They were busy just like the caterpillar. 'Do you think this ant could be the caterpillar's mother? ' Amma asked. 'No! said Kavita, shaking her head. 'The caterpillar is yellow and the ant is not! So, the ant cannot be the caterpillar's mother''What about that jewel beetle there? ' asked Amma pointing to the shining insect on a dry leaf. 'Do you think that might be the caterpillar's mother? ' 'No! ' said Kavita, shaking her head. 'The caterpillar has stripes and the beetle has spots! So the beetle cannot be the caterpillar's mother! ''Oh! And what about these bees? ' asked Amma as they watched the insects do the bee dance. 'Do you think one of them could be the caterpillar's mother? ' No! ' repeated Kavita, shaking her head. 'The caterpillar cannot fly, but the bee can! So, the bee cannot be the caterpillar's mother! ''How about that dragonfly there? ' asked Amma. Kavita was amazed to see the dragonfly's wings that were as clear as water. 'No! ' she said, shaking her head again. 'The caterpillar does not have wings and the dragonfly does! So the dragonfly cannot be the caterpillar's mother. ''Look there! ' exclaimed Amma pointing to the praying mantis. Kavita examined the insect that looked like it had joined its hands to pray. 'What about this one? ' Amma asked. 'No! ' said Kavita, shaking her head. 'The caterpillar has many short legs and the praying mantis has six long ones. So, the praying mantis cannot be the caterpillar's mother. 'Kavita was tired of searching. 'We are never going to find the caterpillar's mother! ' she sighed. 'Let's go back where we began, ' said Amma. 'And this time, keep your eyes open! ' 'Amma, my eyes are open! ' insisted Kavita. 'Well then, ' said Amma, 'This time, keep your mind open too! 'Kavita and Amma went back to the rows of shrubs where they had begun the search. And this time, Kavita noticed dozens of butterflies hovering over the plants. There were white butterflies with orange tips and orange ones with black stripes. Tiny yellow ones and large red ones.Kavita gazed at the butterflies as they danced around the shrubs. She tried to chase them but somehow they got away, returning to the same shrub over and over again. Kavita was puzzled and looked up at Amma who was smiling as if she were try to hint at something.Kavita looked at the butterfly closely. The caterpillar had stripes. The butterfly did not. The caterpillar was yellow. The butterfly was not. The caterpillar had no wings. The butterfly had four. The caterpillar couldn't fly. The butterfly had a bouncy flight. The caterpillar had many tiny legs. The butterfly had six long ones. 'No! ' said Kavita, shaking her head again. 'It can't be! ' 'Yes! ' exclaimed Amma, nodding her head.'Really? ' asked Kavita in disbelief. 'Yes! ' said Amma with a smile. 'You have finally found the caterpillar's mother! ' 'But. . . but. . . ' Kavita hesitated. 'But the caterpillar looks nothing like her mother! ' she said. 'That's right! ' responded Amma. 'The caterpillar looks nothing like her mother. ' 'They are both beautiful just the way they are! ''I am like the little hungry caterpillar! ' giggled Kavita after a pause. 'Soon you'll turn into a big bouncy butterfly! ' laughed Amma. Kavita smiled. No, she didn't need to look like her mother. Because not everyone does.	./Story text files/388.txt	4822	16	5.49009009009009	469	86	99	32.49305555555556	111	33	21	6.965277777777778	100	44	337	218	4	1.3761194029850747	568	102

Even my teddy becomes a different sort of bear.I keep very still in my cave of blankets or I call, “Maaamaaa! Daaaddyyy!” or I jump into their bed.I tell Mama about Pirate and Tree and Bear.“You had a really bad dream.” “What’s a dream?” “When we sleep we think about our day, but everything gets mixed up. It feels real, but it’s not real.”“It is real!” “You know when we read a story together, it’s made up, but we laugh, or get scared or excited? A dream is the same.”“You mean a dream is a story?” “Yes! But it happens at night. You put your head on the pillow, you fall asleep and then the story happens.” “So a dream is a story you find in your pillow?”“Yes!” “Can I put the stories in my pillow?” “You can.” “How?”“Let’s write down all your best stories, fold up the paper and tuck it inside the pillow.”When the stars are out and the moon swings in the sky, and the light in my room is low, things are different.for ilyas tomÁs	./Story text files/397.txt	1114	14	5.707964601769912	94	19	109	40.2962962962963	20	7	23	8.851851851851851	16	11	75	38	4	1.2954545454545454	125	7
Samira made a face when she opened her tiffin box and thought, ‘Who wants to eat parathas and brinjal curry? Not I. ’ Last week Amma had given her noodles with capsicum and carrots. “The noodles are squiggly and they look like worms,” she said when she went back home.“I don’t like noodles.” The next day, Amma made upma with peanuts and peas, but Samira ate only the peanuts in it and took the rest back home. “It was like wet sand,” she said when Amma asked her why she hadn’t eaten it.“Shall I give you idlis?” asked Amma. “Oh, yes ! They would be lovely to play with. I can toss and catch them. But I will not eat them—idlis taste like mud.” So now there were parathas and brinjal curry. Ugh, ugh, ugh!Shutting her tiffin box with a bang, Samira went to the school courtyard. A row of ants crawling along the wall said, “Samira, why aren’t you eating your lunch like all the other children?” Samira said, “I don’t like parathas. I don’t like vegetables. I don’t want any lunch.”“Of course, one cannot eat vegetables,” the ants agreed. They offered her the wing of a cockroach that they were carefully carrying and said, “Now try this, it is really delicious.” “Oh no! I don’t want any horrible cockroaches,” said Samira and ran away to the garden.Colourful flowers were blooming in the garden and butterflies were flitting from one to the other. An orange butterfly with black checks and stripes said, “Hello Samira! Why aren’t you eating your lunch like all the other children?”Samira said, “I don’t like parathas. I don’t like vegetables. I don’t want any lunch.” “Of course, one cannot eat vegetables,” the butterfly agreed. “Why don’t you drink some nectar from the flowers like us? It is really delicious.”Samira put her tongue into the centre of a flower but could find nothing! “I don’t want any nectar. And I think you are fooling me,” she cried. She ran to the big pipal tree in the lawn.A crow cawing above called, “Hello Samira! Why aren’t you eating your lunch like all the other children?” Samira said, “I don’t like parathas. I don’t like vegetables. I don’t want any lunch.”“Of course, one cannot eat vegetables,” the crow agreed, “Here, I’ll give you something nice,” and it dropped a half eaten mouse for Samira. “Oh no! What a terrible thing! Keep your mouse for yourself,” screamed Samira and ran away to stand near the wall.Some sparrows were chirruping on the ledge of the wall and called out, “Hello Samira! Why aren’t you eating your lunch like all the other children?” Samira said, “I don’t like parathas. I don’t like vegetables. I don’t want any lunch.”“Of course, one cannot eat vegetables,” the sparrows agreed. “Here are some crunchy grains of barley — they are really nutritious.” Samira chewed one and made a face. “This is like eating pebbles. Even upma is better.”A kind sparrow at once asked her, “Would you like some soft, juicy worms instead? Just a minute…” Just before it flew off to get her a worm, Samira said, “Worms indeed. No, thank you! I would much rather eat noodles,” and ran to the gate of the school.A cow was lazily chewing cud just outside and mooed when it saw Samira. “Hello!” it called, “Why aren’t you eating your lunch like all the other children?” Samira said, “I don’t like parathas. I don’t like vegetables, especially brinjals. I don’t want any lunch.”“Of course, cooked brinjals aren’t nice at all,” the cow agreed. “Let me bite off some of this grass for you — it is particularly sweet after the rains. You should eat it with the hibiscus bush next to you. You are so lucky. I wish I could get inside this gate.”Samira was disgusted. She said, “I don’t want to eat any grass. Nor any bushes. Even idlis would taste better than grass. And I am glad the gate is closed because the hibiscus has pretty flowers and I don’t want you to eat them.”Samira ran back to her classroom and opened her lunch box. ‘How nice my parathas and brinjal curry are, ’ she thought and quickly ate them up.	./Story text files/316.txt	3949	17	5.642533936651584	365	77	140	49.0	45	34	25	9.91139240506329	39	40	288	154	5	1.424901185770751	444	62

In the Far Forest, among the many hawthorn bushes lived a very small spider called Spincy. He is rather happy that his great, great, great grandfather was the spider of the “Incy wincy spider. . .” nursery rhyme. Spincy told this story to his friends Bret, the beetle and Bret’s brother, Little Bit.Bret and Little Bit did not have anyone famous in their family. They had no time to think about such things. The beetles were busy from morning to night, gathering food, helping in the house, staying out of harm’s way.Spincy was lucky. All he did was spin a web, which was his home and wait for the flies to get caught so he had plenty of time to think about being famous like his great, great, great grandfather.Spincy wanted to be famous, but did not know how. One day he spun a thread from his web and went to another branch, to look for ‘famous’; then the second branch, third branch, fourth branch, till he reached branch number ten. He did not find ‘famous’ anywhere. He asked his friends how to get famous, they also did not know what famous was.One sunny morning, Bret and Little Bit came to visit Spincy. Between them they rolled a dead fly into Spincy’s web as a present. Spincy was very pleased and made his guests as comfortable as possible. “Spincy, I have news for you. I think I know what ‘famous’ is.” Spincy was so excited, that he nearly dropped the fly he was eating.“What is it Bret?” “Well, Little Bit and I are friends with Peel, the Parrot. We are not close friends; he sometimes throws pieces of fruit from the tree for us, so you could say we are friends.”Bret liked to talk and got carried away and forgot what he had come to say. Spincy knew this, so he interrupted. “What did Peel, the Parrot say about famous?” Bret continued, “Peel, the Parrot stays with people, they talk about famous people. Peel thinks that you have to do something, which no one else has done. Peel says famous is when everyone knows your name.”Spincy was no wiser than before. Little Bit tried to comfort Spincy, “I think you are famous, I know your name. Bret knows your name. Peel, the Parrot knows your name. All the spiders in this bush know your name.” Spincy just shook his head and all his eight legs.“No one has written a nursery rhyme on Spincy, the Spider,” he said sadly. Bret and Little Bit went away, rather sad too. They had not been able to help their friend become famous.Spincy sat down to think about what he could do that no other spider had done. He spun a perfect web. All spiders spin perfect webs. He caught flies. So did the other spiders.He could climb up and down really fast. Other spiders did the same. There was nothing he could do that the others could not. Many days passed and Spincy was no nearer to being famous. One day, while he was sitting in the middle of his web, he heard Bret shouting, “Spincy, Little Bit is hurt, help! Help!” Spincy ran as fast as he could.He saw that a large stone had fallen on Little Bit. Little Bit had managed to crawl from under it, but had broken his leg and hurt his sides. He was lying very still. Bret and the other beetles were running around helplessly.Spincy asked Bret to get a small leaf. Bret got the leaf. As it was getting dark and spiders don’t see too well, Bret asked his cousins, the glow worms, to come and light up the place.Spincy put the stem of the leaf on the broken leg, folded the leaf over it, and started spinning a spider thread around the leg, stem and leaf together, till it was nicely bandaged in spider silk. He put a piece of leaf on Bit’s hurt side and spun a little silk patch on it. Little Bit was already feeling much better. The other beetles helped Little Bit into his house. Spincy sat down tired but happy. He had helped save his friend’s life. It was time to go home and rest.As Spincy walked home, he saw beetles of all sizes walking with him. The glow worms twinkled overhead like so many stars, lighting Spincy’s way. They were all singing a rhyme, Peel, the Parrot had made.“Spincy, the Spider, is kinder, Than any other Spider, He can bandage your leg, Spinning a patch, Spincy, the Spider has no match.”In days to come, everybody from Far Forest had heard of Spincy. If you find the Far Forest, you too can hear this rhyme. It is sung in the evening, when the glow worms come out and light up Spincy’s hawthorn bush. What does Spincy feel? Spincy says “I don’t care to be famous. I am happy that when my friends need help, they call my name.”	./Story text files/297.txt	4456	18	5.5809935205183585	410	53	195	57.64473684210526	35	41	37	11.868421052631579	28	48	273	190	5	1.3085714285714285	501	24
Manju was fascinated by locks and keys. The soft metallic sound of a key turning in a lock made her happy. The key bunch Mummy kept tied to her saree was Manju’s favourite toy. She loved to explore the mysterious depths of keyholes. Manju passed the village locksmith Ranjith’s shop on her way to school every day. She loved to listen to the rasping of the tools as he made new keys.One day, Mummy needed to get a new key for her almirah. Manju went with her to Ranjith’s shop. Ranjith picked up a flat piece of metal. “What is this?” Manju asked.“This is a blank key,” replied Ranjith. Then he held up Mummy’s key and said, “See these pointy bits that look like mountains? And these curvy bits that look like valleys? Your almirah lock also has mountains and valleys inside it. The key’s mountains and valleys fit that pattern. So when you turn the key, the lock opens! I am copying the mountains and valleys from the old key to the new one. So the new key will also open the almirah.”Back home, Manju couldn’t stop talking about the locksmith. She told Munira Aunty, who lived next door. She even told her cat, who stopped licking his face for half a minute and looked bored. When her cousin Riju came to visit that evening, she told her too. Riju was studying to be an engineer.“Do you know, Riju didi,” Manju said, “if you want to make a new key for a lock, you have to copy the pattern of mountains and valleys from the old key to a blank key?”“Really?” said Riju. “Then it’s a very good thing that Mummy keeps the keys safe. Otherwise anyone could copy the key and steal our things!” “That’s true!” “This is the sort of thing that I am studying,” said Riju.“What, making keys?” asked Manju. “Something similar,” replied Riju. “We lock up things we want to keep safe, like the sarees in our almirah, right?” Manju nodded. “But what if the thing you want to keep safe is information?” “Like what, Riju didi?” asked Manju. “Like how much money you have in your bank account. Or your best friend’s secret. Or the notebook of recipes passed down from our grandmother to your mother.” “Oh yes, we need to keep those safe,” agreed Manju.“If we have to protect this information, we have to put it in a safe place and lock it! There are many safe places. Like my computer, where I keep my college notes,” said Riju. She opened her laptop. “To see my work, you have to type the password here!” “What’s a password?” Manju wanted to know.“A password is like a key. The almirah’s lock opens only when the pattern on the key fits the pattern in the lock, like a jigsaw puzzle. My computer will only open if the password I type matches the password I have set. If you tell anyone the password, they can open it too! So you have to be very careful whom you give your password to.” “Hmmm… When I get a computer, what should I set as my password?” Manju wondered aloud.“Some people’s passwords are really easy to guess – their date of birth, their pet’s name, or the name of their street. A good password is difficult to guess. The longer it is, the harder it is to guess. It is better if it has letters and numbers. But a password should also be easy to remember.” Just then, Mummy called Riju, who ran off to greet her aunt. TING! went Riju’s mobile.What might that be? A new game? Riju had the best games! Manju often spent her evenings pestering her cousin to let her play. Today, she would play them by herself. Manju pressed a button on her cousin’s phone. The screen lit up. A keypad with numbers appeared. It needed a password!She pressed . “Incorrect password” appeared on the screen. Then she tried , but the phone did not unlock. She also tried Riju’s birthday, . “Hoi!” That was Riju.“I’ve locked my phone with a password,” she said. “And I don’t give it to nosey little girls.” Manju stuck her tongue out.“Now do you see why passwords are so important, Manju?” Riju said. “They’re like keys to the things we want to keep private.” “Yes, didi,” said Manju. “I only wanted to play some games!” “And you only had to ask!” Riju said, typing in her password. “Let me show you a new game – Guess the Password!”Play with Manju This game gives you clues to passwords. See if you can crack them. Phone passwords . Manju is nine years younger than her cousin. If Manju chooses her birth year as her password, what would it be? . If Riju’s password is her date of birth backwards, it would be. . . . Remember the first password Manju tried on Riju’s phone? What’s that in reverse order? Answers: .  .  . Did you solve the clues? Remember, if you did, others can too. So here are some simple dos and don’ts: . Don’t keep passwords that are too short (, xyz, abcd are weak passwords). . Remember your password so that you do not have to write it down. If you write it down, someone might be able to find it. . Use both upper and lower cases (ComPUteR). . Don’t use words that are easy to guess (The name of your school, dog or town). Passwords are used to ‘unlock’ or open mobile phones, computers, safety vaults in banks, our accounts on websites, and many other things. Fingerprints and retina scans are also used as passwords. These are called biometric passwords.A password could also be a set pattern you trace on the screen. Like this:	./Story text files/56.txt	5229	14	5.586994727592267	463	106	166	41.868852459016395	77	45	36	8.934426229508198	61	61	301	268	4	1.3214285714285714	626	46
YAWN! Kottavi Raja was sleepy. His ministers were talking about a complex problem and he was bored. He hadn’t slept well last night, or the night before. Or the thirty nights before that. He tried to concentrate on what they were saying. But the sentences were so garbled!“Insofar as the lessee is concerned, the right glablaglablaaa to till and tax blblblublooo loooballaooozzzzzzzzzzzz.” His head lolled forward. Raja Nalan was a good king. But of late, he had a problem staying awake during the day. He yawned in court all the time. So people had started calling him Kottavi Raja, because ‘kottavi’ means ‘yawn’ in Tamil.“Sujata,” he asked his queen one night, gently waking her up, “how come you are so alert and energetic throughout the day?” “Because I sleep at night,” she snapped. “And so should you.” Yes, sleep at night. But how? He was always sleepy during the day, sleepiest in the evening. But by night, he was alert, not at all sleepy! The next morning, in court, Kottavi Raja asked, “Prime Minister, what do you do when you aren’t sleepy at night?” “I ask Nidra Devi, the goddess of sleep, to bless me,” he said. “How?” “My mother used to say the goddess cannot resist a full stomach. So I ask my cook to serve a rich dinner, full of warm, sweet things. Two minutes after eating it, I’m fast asleep.” Kottavi Raja saw the minister’s round stomach. And believed him.The Finance Minister did not want to be left out. So he said, “I drink warm milk with honey at night. Simple, no fuss. No need to trouble the cook. And I always sleep a full nine hours.” The court musician did not like all these stories of food. When his stomach was full, he couldn’t sing. But he wanted to help. So he said, “In our family, my lord, we always invite Nidra Devi with music. A beautiful Neelambari, sung with the veena… Ah, bliss!”The poet said, “A gentle stroll in the palace gardens with a soft breeze blowing and the moonlight falling on parijatham f lowers. . . . ah! The beauty and poetry of the moment will wash away all your worries, Maharaja. Nidra Devi loves a peaceful mind.” The court jester added, “If nothing else works, my lord, a good story will always get you to sleep.”‘So many things to try, ’ thought Kottavi Raja. ‘One of them has to work. ’ That evening, the royal cooks were asked to prepare a special meal.Warm rice with ghee, hot sambar, fried potatoes, yam and khus khus payasam. And, to wash it all down, cool buttermilk. The king wanted to be sure that he would sleep at night, so he took two helpings of every dish. It was nearly  pm when he finished. Yet – old habits are hard to break – he wasn’t sleepy.He tossed and he turned and he became very unhappy with his Prime Minister. Nidra Devi was missing! He decided he simply hadn’t eaten enough. “Cook!” he bellowed. A sleepy cook hurriedly dressed and ran to the king. “Get me a large glass of warm milk with honey! Hurry!”Kottavi Raja gulped it down. Ouch! He was soooo full. He couldn’t get up, he couldn’t move and he definitely couldn’t lie down and fall asleep. ‘Perhaps I should try music, ’ he thought. He sent for the court musicians. They came, turbans askew, with hurriedly tied dhotis. It was past midnight.“Play Neelambari for me!” he said. It was wonderful to listen to the melody in the still night. Kottavi Raja relaxed. What bliss! Twenty minutes later, his eyelids began to droop. . . Then – TWANG! THUD! The veena player had fallen asleep on his instrument. .They began again. But one after the other, the sleepy musicians dropped notes and played the wrong tune. It was cacophony. Nidra Devi heard those tunes and bolted! And the king was wide awake and very annoyed. He remembered his jester’s idea and summoned him. “Tell me a story!” he said.The jester started a long boring story, hoping that the king would fall asleep. Ah, but our Kottavi Raja was not pleased. He got impatient and kept saying, “Yes, yes, but how does the story end?” Nidra Devi didn’t like the impatience. So she kept away. One hour later, a hoarse jester ended the story and went home blearyeyed. And the king? He was still awake. He woke the queen up and insisted on taking a stroll. She got ready grumpily.“Just up to the jasmine garden, okay? After that I’ll come back and sleep!” They walked in the moonshine, heard the drowsy tittering of birds and went around the large palace garden. The king found himself calming down and thought, ‘Aha! Now is the time to go back and sleep. ’ As he settled down, there was a dreamy silence all around. Until he heard a curious rumbling. From his stomach. The music, the story, the breeze, and the walk had made him hungry!The queen took matters into her hands. She ordered a small glass of milk, and got a masseuse to press his legs. In a few minutes, Nidra Devi came and blessed the king. The palace finally shut down for the night.Every day, this routine continued. Over time, Kottavi Raja started to sleep earlier. In two weeks, he found that he fell asleep after his second glass of milk. A few weeks after that, he started sleeping just after his walk. A month later, the jester’s story put him to sleep. And finally, he managed to sleep right after dinner. Most mornings, he woke up feeling fresh! He walked with a bounce in his step and smiled at everyone.But what about the cooks, the musicians, the jester, the masseuse, the queen? They remained on standby through the night – they never knew when the king might wake and ask for them. And they were sleepy, tired and grumpy all day. So were the people who waited for them  the cook’s wife, the musician’s son, the jester’s brother, the masseuse’s father, the queen’s maid, the maid’s husband, the husband’s brother, the brother’s friend, the friend’s parents. . . the whole city. The king grew worried about his sleepless people. He couldn’t recommend his elaborate remedy to everyone. So he asked his chief priest for a solution. The wise man knew that this was a tough problem. He said, “Get everyone to assemble in the town hall fifteen days from now. They should have a warm bath, finish dinner and arrive at sunset. I will summon Nidra Devi to bless everyone.”So the entire city gathered. They were all relieved that their sleepless nights were going to end. The priest began to chant hymns in praise of the goddess.A few minutes into his droning, a new mother, the sleepiest of them all, yawned. Looking at her, her infant yawned. The baby’s father saw this and. . . yes, yawned. A musician yawned halfway through a tune, and twenty people around him yawned. Then, their neighbours yawned and a mighty wave of yawns swept through the gathering.Nidra Devi couldn’t resist the power of so many yawns. She came running to the city, and touched everyone with a cooling breeze. And from that night onwards, she continued to bless everyone in Kottavi Raja’s land, every night.	./Story text files/346.txt	6850	26	5.840055632823366	591	128	226	44.67333333333333	92	58	37	9.173333333333334	69	81	420	299	5	1.3934040047114251	758	91

Blue skies and calm waters — a perfect day for diving! We set out in a little boat, hoping for a BIG adventure!When we reached the dive site, we carefully checked all our equipment and put on our fins and masks.As soon as we were underwater, we were greeted by a school of yellowback fusiliers.There were so many different creatures to see around this large table coral: oriental sweetlips, parrotfish, batfish, and even a beautifullypatterned nudibranch. To know more about the creatures marked out in bold lettering, turn to the back section of this book.This trumpetfish changed colour to try and blend in with a school of yellow tang, but you can pick him out easily enough, can’t you?It’s a good thing we kept a safe distance from this lionfish. The spines on his back can be quite poisonous!These clownfish carefully guarded their sea anemone home, but finally agreed to let me take a few pictures.We saw a honeycomb moray eel having its teeth cleaned by cleaner wrasses, and another pair even offered to give us a scrub!There were triggerfish and sea urchins. We even saw a coral grouper and a reef octopus playing hideandseek.The octopus won the game. They’re masters of disguise. Pipefish are great at disguise too. Can you spot the two ghost pipefish in this picture?We came across a couple of whitetip reef sharks resting near the bottom. They’re pretty harmless, so we swam in for a closer look.We followed this hawksbill turtle for a while as he looked around the reef for a nice sea sponge to lunch on.As we made our way back to the boat, we were thrilled to see a manta ray ‘flying’ through the water with two remora fish in tow.And just when we thought this dive couldn’t possibly get any better, we sighted a dugong grazing on some sea grass.What an incredible experience! I can’t wait to go diving again!Corals are both plants and animals. Thousands of little algae live inside corals, and give them energy to grow. They have hard outer skeletons and grow into many different shapes. Plankton is the main source of food for many sea creatures. They are a mix of algae, bacteria, tiny animals, and the eggs and larvae of larger animals that float about with the ocean currents. Feather stars may look like plants, but they’re really animals. They use their featherlike ‘arms’ to catch and eat bits of floating plankton.Parrotfish have strong teeth that form a parrotlike beak, which they use to scrape algae off hard coral. Some species don’t mind eating bits of coral as well, and they later poop out a fine sand that washes up on land to form beautiful white beaches. Clownfish and sea anemones live together and help each other. The clownfish help the anemones by cleaning their tentacles and luring other fish for the anemone to eat. The anemones, in turn, allow the clownfish to hide among their poisonous tentacles without stinging them. Cleaner wrasses are small fish that keep bigger fish clean by feeding on their parasites and dead skin. The bigger fish recognise the wrasses by their colours and the dancelike way they move.The reef octopus can hide by changing its colour and texture. It makes its home in holes in the reef, or buries itself in the sand. Ghost pipefish can be found in pairs, floating with their heads down and hidden among sea grass, corals or feather stars. Like the reef octopus, they can change colour to blend in perfectly. The whitetip reef shark has a thin body, broad head, and white tips on its dorsal and tail fin. They hunt at night, and sleep through most of the day.The hawksbill turtle has a flat body, a shell with jagged edges, and a sharp, curving mouth that looks like a hawk’s beak. Manta rays are huge fish with winglike fins on the sides of their bodies. These large fins help them swim gracefully through the water. On some manta rays, the distance from one wing tip to the other can reach up to  feet! The dugong is a vegetarian marine mammal. Its favourite food is sea grass, which it is able to graze on with its speciallyshaped snout. Dugongs are also called sea cows.	./Story text files/145.txt	4040	20	6.028985507246377	319	95	160	76.71153846153847	11	41	29	14.653846153846153	10	42	228	186	7	1.5595505617977528	376	69

Tenzin and Tashi were two young Tibetan monks. They lived in a small monastery on a beautiful green hill. Here, it was lovely when it rained. When Tashi looked out of the window late one morning, the rain was coming down hard. Rivulets were forming where the water had made paths on the muddy road. Tashi couldn’t think of a better way to spend the afternoon than sailing paper boats. Tashi and Tenzin set about making many paper boats. As soon as it stopped raining, the boys ran outside. They sailed the paper boats they had made – some big, some small. The boats floated nicely along the path. The two young monks were happy.As they trotted back home, they saw Gen Lobsang. Genla lived in the monastery and told the children the most wonderful stories. “Genla,” shouted Tenzin. “Can you tell us a story about why boats float?” Gen Lobsang thought for a minute and said, “I don’t know why boats – or ships, for that matter – float. But I am curious to find out.” Genla: A polite way of addressing the teacher in TibetanGenla and the children decided to go and ask Miss Sonam, the science teacher, if she knew why boats float. Tenzin and Tashi gently pulled Gen Lobsang from his chair. They held his hands to help him walk. When they reached her room, Miss Sonam was reading a book. “Tashi delek,” said Genla, Tashi and Tenzin. “Tashi delek,” she replied. “We have a question for you,” said Genla. Tashi delek: A common Tibetan greeting; tashi means ‘good fortune’ and delek means ‘well being’.“Yes, can you tell us what makes boats float on water, Miss?” Tenzin asked. “I can,” said Miss Sonam. “Or maybe we can find out together?” Before they knew it, Miss Sonam was giving instructions. “Tenzin, please bring a plastic basin from the kitchen.” “Tashi, please fetch a small bucket of water.” “Genla, hold this apple. Please don’t eat it.”Miss Sonam asked Tashi to fill the tub to the brim. “Now, Genla,” she said, “dip the apple in the tub, please. Enough to cover it completely in water.”Genla gently dropped the fruit into the tub and pushed it down with his little finger. Some water spilled. Tashi and Tenzin shrieked, “The water is overflowing!” Genla let go of the apple, and it rose up. Miss Sonam was smiling. “What happened here?” she asked.“Genla pushed the apple into the water,” said Tenzin. “Water spilled,” said Tashi. “The apple’s floating,” said Genla. “Correct answers, all of you!” said Miss Sonam. “Now, can you tell me how much water spilled, Tenzin? Was it about half a cup? One cup?”Tenzin looked at the water on the table and on the floor. He said, “Maybe one cup.” “That sounds right,” said Miss Sonam. Genla and Tashi nodded in agreement. “Now, take the apple out. Tashi, fill up the tub again. Here, Tenzin. Will you drop this spoon into the water?” Tenzin did. The spoon sank to the bottom. “Too heavy,” said Genla. “Not as heavy as a ship in the sea,” said Tenzin. “Very little water spilled this time, not even a quarter of a cup!” said Tashi, a little sad. “Again, you’re all correct,” said Miss Sonam.Then she asked: “Do you see? After Genla dropped the apple into the water, the apple pushed some water away before it could float.” “Is that the water that spilled?” asked Tenzin. “Yes. So the apple could float because it pushed away more water than its own weight. That means, the apple is lighter than the water it pushed away.” “What about the spoon then?” Genla said. “Well, the spoon also pushed some water away. But much less. Certainly less than its own weight. So it sank.”“What about large ships in the sea, on which there are many people?” asked Tenzin. “. . . and many spoons that sink?” added Tashi. “The spoons won’t make a ship sink, Tashi. The ship is big enough to push away a lot of water. Again, like the apple, more water than its own weight. You don’t notice it because in the ocean, there is so much water. The ship is still lighter than the amount of water that it pushes away.” They were all quiet for a bit. “I think I understand,” said Tenzin, slowly.“Can we sail some boats now?” asked Tashi. “It’s time for my tea,” said Genla. Miss Sonam smiled. “Yes, enjoy yourselves!” she said, and gave the boys colour paper to make boats.Tenzin and Tashi made more colourful boats and set them down in the water. “I don’t see any water spilling now,” said Tashi. “No, silly. The water doesn’t always spill. It just gets pushed away,” replied Tenzin. “I think the boats just make some space for themselves in the stream,” said Genla. They watched the blue and yellow boats, red and green boats, and white boats sailing. Like prayer flags floating in the stream.What is Gravity? What would happen if Tenzin dropped a football from the top of a tree? Would it fall to the ground or rise towards the sky? That’s right, it would fall because of a force called gravity. Did you know that everything gets pulled towards the earth by that force?What is Buoyancy? What would happen if Tashi dropped a football into a bucket of water? Would gravity pull the football to the bottom of the bucket? Yes, but in water, there is an upward force that opposes gravity. It is called buoyancy. As gravity tries to pull the football down, buoyancy tries to push it up. In the case of the football, buoyancy is stronger than gravity. So it floats. What would happen if he drops a brick into the bucket? Why?What is Displacement? When you drop an object into water, it tries to make space for itself by pushing some water aside. In other words, the object displaces water to make space for itself. Bigger objects, like a basketball, displace more water than smaller ones, like a cricket ball. A long time ago, a Greek scientist named Archimedes discovered that when the weight of the water displaced by an object is more than the weight of the object, it floats. That is why apples float in water. Can you guess why other objects sink?What is Density? Every object around us is made of tiny particles that can’t be seen with the naked eye. Density is how closely these particles are packed in an object. The weight of Tashi’s small glass marble may be the same as Miss Sonam’s apple. But why is the apple bigger? Because there is more space between the particles in the apple. In the marble, the particles are much closer to each other. An apple is less dense than a marble. Generally, dense objects sink in water. Here’s a game you can play with your friends: Pick four or five objects. Guess which ones will float and which will sink. Then drop them into a bucket or tub of water to check. Have fun!	./Story text files/97.txt	6530	13	5.640338504936531	614	95	169	44.354166666666664	87	57	32	9.159722222222221	74	70	424	285	5	1.3501805054151625	785	46
"Mira could not sit still. The scent of kheer from the kitchen was making her soooo hungry. She loved kheer more than anything else in the world. But when it was finally ready, Papa realised he didn’t have any raisins to put into it.“I’ll quickly go to the market to buy some raisins,” Papa said to Mira. “Don’t eat the kheer yet.” “Yes, Papa,” Mira replied.But when Papa got back home, he saw that not a drop of kheer was left in the pot.“MIRA!” he shouted. “DID YOU EAT THE KHEER?”“No,” Mira replied. “I didn’t eat the kheer, Papa.” “Then who did?” Papa asked. “You won’t believe what happened!” Mira said. “After you left, I saw Kiku was about to eat the kheer. So I had to save it from her! Then Kiku got upset.”“She ran out of the house and into the middle of the road! An auto rickshaw screeched to a halt. ‘OYYYE! ’ shouted the driver. Then a scooter screeched to a halt behind the auto, and a bicyclist slammed her brakes, and a truck honked its horn. ‘OYEEEEE! ’ yelled all the drivers together. ""“Terrified, Kiku ran off again, and I chased after her. We came to a vegetable market. At first, I couldn’t see her anywhere.”“Then I saw her with her mouth stuffed full of spinach. ‘SHOOOO! ’ screamed the vegetable seller, shooing her away.”“Scared, Kiku ran and ran, and I could not find her anywhere! """"Just then, I heard someone scream, ‘AIYYYOOO! There’s a goat eating my flowers! ’ And Kiku came darting down the street, looking frightened.”“‘Kiku! ’ I called, and she ran straight into my arms. I hugged her and brought her home!” Mira finished her story.Papa started laughing. “Mira beta,” he said. “Why are you cooking up stories?” “Huh? I am not!” Mira said. “If you saved the kheer from Kiku, then who ate it?” Papa replied.Mira hadn’t thought about that! Her eyebrows went up. “I don’t know,” she said, scratching her head.Just then, they saw the flash of a monkey’s tail before he jumped out the window. And this time, it was Papa’s eyebrows that went up.“So can we can cook some more kheer, Papa?” Mira asked. Papa laughed. “Yes, my dear. Let’s make some more kheer!”"	./Story text files/122.txt	2086	19	5.766816143497758	181	42	116	33.78333333333333	44	16	23	7.266666666666667	40	20	128	95	3	1.3099630996309963	258	13

Hashim loves mangoes. Every summer, Thamma makes pickle with mangoes. This summer, the mangoes are about to spoil.Baba tells Hashim that if he removes water from the mangoes, they will not spoil. “Germs cannot live without water,” he says.“How do we take water out of the mangoes?” asks Hashim. “Add salt to them!” says Baba.Then Baba and Hashim keep the mangoes out in the sun to dry.They put the mangoes in a bottle with some oil. Oil doesn’t let germs from the air reach the mangoes.“Baba, we have made Thamma’s pickle!” says Hashim.How can we preserve our favourite fruits and vegetables?Potato slice + boil + dry = potato chips (to be fried and eaten) Apple (or any fruit) + sugar + lemon + cook = jamTomato + salt + sun + oil = sundried tomatoes Lemon + salt = lemon preserves	./Story text files/542.txt	782	17	5.298969072164948	78	19	190	47.9375	11	5	41	9.75	8	8	48	49	4	1.462962962962963	99	9
Sister, sister, I wonder. . . What do you wonder, little brother, What do you wonder? I wonder, I wonder, Where the sun goes at night. Where do you think, little brother, Where do you think? I think, I think. . . Tell me, little brother, What do you think?I think That maybe, a demon. The terrible black demon Of Darkness Eats up the sun each night For dinner. See how the blue sky, at sunset, Is stained red with his blood?But the sun The glorious brave shining golden sun He fights the Darkness demon All night, every night And by morning, He’s whole again and back to rule. That’s where I think the sun goes at night. Into the mouth of a monster After a terrible fight. I’m clever, aren’t I, sister?Oh yes you are, little brother, oh yes you are And maybe you are right, too. . . But in the books that I have read That is not what they said. Then what did they say, sister, What did they say? What do you think, little brother, What do you think? I think, I think. . . Tell me, little brother, what do you think?I think That maybe, while it is night Here on earth, It is a glorious day in The ocean's darkest depths. And the mermaids come dancing out Of their undersea caves To frolic with the sharks.We have seen it ourselves When we went to Mumbai last summer. Remember How the sun lets go of the sky Each evening at dusk And slides soundlessly into the sea? That’s were I think the sun goes at night To flood the underwater With golden light. I’m clever, aren’t I sister?Of course you are, little brother, Of course you are And maybe you are right, too. . . But in the books that I have read That is not what they said. Then what did they say, sister, What did they say? What do you think, little brother, What do you think?I think, I think. . . Tell me, little brother, what do you think? I think That maybe there is no mystery. That maybe the sun is just like Father. He goes home tired each night After a long day At work.And his wife, like Mother, Fusses over him, shushes the kids, Covers him with a nightdark blanket of stars, And hopes his snoring will not keep her awake all night.And every morning, the sun Shrugs off his starblanket, Paints the dawn sky red with his sleepy eyes And gets back to work. That’s where I think the sun goes at night. Home to bed until it is light. I’m clever, aren’t I, sister?I know you are, little brother, I know you are, And maybe you’re right, too. . . But in the books that I have read That is not what they said. Then what did they say, sister, What did they say? Come here, little brother, I’ll tell you what they said. They said, they said. . . Tell me, sister, what did they say?They said That the earth is like a ball That the ball goes around the sun Spinning like the red top Mother got you from the Saturday market, But slower.And they said Every spin of the earth Is as long as a day And a night. I asked about the sun, sister, I asked about the sun. I am coming to that, little brother, Be patient now.They said When our part of the earth The half where we live Is turned towards the sun We have day. And when the other half Is turned towards the sun And ours Is turned away We have night.They said That’s where the sun goes at night To bathe the other half in glorious light. Can it be true, sister, can it be true? I can’t say, little brother, I can’t say. But in all the books that I have read That is what they said.FIND OUT MORE! Where does the sun go at night? The earth is a sphere that revolves around the sun, along with the seven other planets of the solar system. One revolution of the earth around the sun takes one calendar year. While it is going around the sun, the earth also spins on its own axis. Each ‘spin’ takes  hours, that is, a day and a night. Whichever part of the earth is facing the sun has day. At the same time, the other half of the earth (the part turned away from the sun) has night. Then the earth slowly spins around and the half that was in darkness (that is, the half that was turned away from the sun) now faces the sun. So this half has day, and the other half, which turned away from the sun has night. So, in reality, the sun does not really go anywhere at night!Try this experiment! To understand how the earth’s rotation causes day and night, try this simple exercise. You need: A small rubber ball A big torch Some felt pens A friend What to do: Imagine that the rubber ball is the earth. Using the felt pens, draw the map of the world on the rubber ball. Now, imagine that the torch is the sun. Ask your friend to switch on the torch.Place the ball (the earth) directly in the path of the torch beam (sunlight), so that India is facing the sun. Turn the ball around slowly. What do you see? When India is facing the sun, the Americas are in darkness. As India begins to turn away from the sun, Europe and Africa come into the ‘sunlight’. Then, as the ‘earth’ continues to turn, the Americas come into the light and India becomes dark. Keep turning the ball till India faces the sun again. This is what happens every time the earth turns around on its axis. During each rotation, India (and every other place on earth) has one day and one night.	./Story text files/123.txt	5150	12	5.24	460	65	163	51.56122448979592	45	53	30	11.193877551020408	33	65	376	149	4	1.2003311258278146	572	32

Tingu Tiger is not happy with his skin. “It’s furry and orange with black stripes. I wish my skin was rough and grey,” says Tingu.Tingu Tiger likes Ranga Rhino’s skin very much. “Will you change skins with me, Ranga?” asks Tingu. “What fun!” says Ranga. “Let’s do that!”Tingu gives Ranga his furry skin. Ranga gives Tingu her rough skin.“Thank you, Ranga Rhino! I really love my new skin.” “No, no, I am Ranga Rhiger now. And you are not a tiger anymore.” “Right, I am a tino now!” says Tingu.Tingu Tino jumps, dances, swims, runs, and marches happily in his new grey skin.After a while, the skin becomes itchy, scratchy and boring.“I think I will get my old skin back. It was softer, smoother and more fun,” thinks Tingu. “Ranga Rhiger! Where are you?”“Ah, there you are Ranga Rhiger!” Tingu calls out. “No, no! I am not a rhiger now,” says Ranga. “I changed skins with Bubbloo Bear. I am now Ranga Rhear!”“I want my nice old skin back,” sighs Tingu. “Where is Bubbloo Bear?” “There by the pond,” Ranga Rhear points. “But Bubbloo is now a biger!”Bubbloo Biger says “No!” to Tingu. “I don’t want that rough, grey skin and be a bino!” Bubbloo says angrily.“But I don’t want to remain a tino!” cries poor Tingu.Bubbloo Biger has a great idea. “Let’s ask Rani Simmy what to do.”Rani Simmy roars and growls at them. “What nonsense, you silly animals! Change back to your skins right now.”“Ranga, give that skin back to Bubbloo! Bubbloo, give that skin back to Tingu! Tingu, give that skin back to Ranga!” The rhear, the biger and the tino do as they are told. They are back to being a rhino, a bear and a tiger.When Tingu, Ranga and Bubbloo go away, Rani Simmy grins to herself. “That was fun!

"Cheekoo was the unhappiest girl among her friends. She was certainly the unhappiest girl in her entire class. She was perhaps the unhappiest girl in the world.Friends? Cheekoo had no friends anymore. No one wanted to play with Cheekoo. Because she had a cloud hanging over her head. A cloud of TRASH.Orange peels and biscuit packets, Broken toys and pencil shavings, Twisted plastic bottles and colourful plastic bags, All surrounded by a swarm of buzzing flies.No one wanted to play with a girl who had a cloud of trash hanging over her. What if a rotten banana peel fell on your head? YUCK! Cheekoo couldn’t even play hide andseek anymore. The cloud would always give her away.""Let’s walk to school together, "" she said to Sona. Sona ran off in the opposite direction. ""May I borrow your pencil sharpener? "" she asked Sweety. Sweety made a face and changed her seat to go sit with Asha. Cheekoo even had to eat her lunch alone. Cheekoo knew that she should have listened to her Amma. Amma always told her not to litter.""Don’t throw the banana peel on the road! "" ""Throw the empty biscuit packet in the dustbin. "" But Cheekoo never listened. She only laughed and kept littering.Then one day, Amma became very angry. ""Soon, all this trash will start following you! "" she said. Cheekoo just laughed. The next morning, Cheekoo woke up to a foul smell and the sound of buzzing flies. The cloud of trash was hanging over her head. Amma’s words had come true! And then, Cheekoo was unable to laugh.Cheekoo tried to run away. But the trash cloud followed her everywhere. Cheekoo took a broom to sweep the cloud down. But the trash could not be swept away.Cheekoo tried EVERYTHING. She screamed and asked the cloud to leave her alone. She even tried throwing the cloud into the dustbin. But the cloud of trash just wouldn’t go. So Cheekoo became very unhappy.Then something happened! Cheekoo saw Bala throwing a banana peel on the road. Cheekoo was annoyed. Could he not see the cloud over her head? ""Oye silly boy! "" she yelled. ""Don’t throw the peel on the road. Someone will slip! "" Bala, scared of the trash cloud, threw the peel in the dustbin.The next day, the trash cloud had become smaller! ""How did that happen? "" Cheekoo wondered. Then, Cheekoo saw Reema Aunty throwing away plastic bags. ""Aunty! "" Cheekoo said. ""Please pick up these bags and reuse them. "" Reema Aunty picked up the bags and left. The next day when Cheekoo woke up, the cloud was much smaller. Cheekoo smiled. She knew what she had to do.When someone threw away a biscuit packet or pencil shavings, Cheekoo stopped them. She picked up every twisted plastic bottle and put it in the dustbin. The village became cleaner and cleaner. And Cheekoo’s cloud became smaller and smaller. Until one day, it was gone. COMPLETELY gone. Cheekoo was now perhaps the happiest girl in the world.Cheekoo never littered again. Secretly, she liked living in a clean village. But she was also scared that the trash cloud would come back, some day. Who knew!Let’s Talk About Trash Ever wondered what happens to trash once you throw it away? No, it doesn’t become a cloud on your head. The trash ends up in a big garbage bin near your home. When you litter, the trash collects by the side of the road. Some of it goes into the drains that carry waste water from your house. This clogs the drains and attracts flies which spread nasty diseases! UGH! Nobody likes living in a dirty environment. Ask Cheekoo.Here’s how NOT to make a cloud of trash  We can start by not littering our surroundings.  Always, always throw waste into a dustbin – look around for the nearest one. After you eat a banana, don’t throw it on the road. Put the peel in a small bag until you find a dustbin.  There are many things that you may think are useless, like the paper bag into which you put the peel. But not everything is waste. So don’t throw the bag with the peel! Take it home and reuse it.  Cover dustbins so that flies can’t get inside."	./Story text files/267.txt	3971	14	5.733644859813084	356	72	161	41.70967741935484	66	27	25	8.67741935483871	48	45	267	161	4	1.3209393346379648	472	39

We will build a pagoda on that spot!” the King said to his people.The white elephant stopped on top of a hill. “Let us build a pagoda to Lord Buddha right here!” said the King.Soon the pagoda rose high, filling the sky. The King lifted his head to look up at the tippy tippy top and thank the Lord. DHUPP! His crown rolled off! Everyone was nervous. They picked it up and gave it back to the King.The King visited the pagoda every day. He found that he could look up till the doorway of the pagoda.

It contains a bat, gloves, and guards for the thighs, arms, and abdomen.Anu’s friends from school come over. Mridula and Shanta have partial vision, just like Anu. Amita cannot see at all. Rumi’s vision is better than all of theirs.At the field, Papa fixes wickets at both ends of the pitch. These wickets are made of hollow metal so that the players can hear the ball hitting the wicket. TWAAANG! Papa shakes the fibre plastic ball. JHAL JHAL JHAL. Inside the ball are bearings that rattle. “Anu, this sound will tell you how close the ball is,” says Papa. He hands the ball to Shanta and asks her to shout ‘READY? ’ before bowling underarm. “When Anu says, ‘YES’, you shout ‘PLAY’ and release the ball at the same time.”Anu takes position. “READY?” “YES!” “PLAY!”JHAL JHAL JHAL. The ball bounces on the pitch four times. Oh no! Anu misses it. Shanta bowls again. And TWHAAAACK! The ball flies to the corner of the field. FOUR RUNS!The girls practise every day. Two months go by. At school, the sports teacher announces that Anu and her friends will play an interschool cricket match. The girls are excited.“Tails!” Anu’s team wins the toss and they choose to field. Anu bowls the first over. “READY?” she shouts. “YES!” Anu takes a deep breath, runs and shouts, “PLAY!”JHAL JHAL JHAL. The ball bounces on the pitch with a crackle and Sohini, who is batting, hits it hard. THWACK! It flies across the boundary and the umpire declares a six. The crowd cheers. Anu is charged up. She knows she has to get this wicket. THWACK! The ball shoots upwards and. . . Mridula catches it.A new player, Paula, takes position at the crease. Anu runs and releases the ball. TWANG TWANG. “Another wicket down!” announces the umpire. Two wickets down. The audience cheers, hattrick, hattrick! Can Anu do it?This time, batswoman Zoya takes position. Anu’s heart is beating fast and she tries to ignore the butterflies in her stomach. She bowls. Zoya misses the ball but she has stepped out of the crease to take a run. Rumi, who is at the wickets, gets hold of the ball and aims it at the stumps.Stumped! Howzzat! “Hattrick! Hattrick! Hattrick!” roars the crowd.About Blind Cricket Blind Cricket has been adapted for visuallyimpaired players who can’t see or maybe see just a little. The rules of this game are a little different from the standard rules of cricket. There are  players in each team, in which four or more players are totally blind.The biggest difference is the ball. It is filled with ball bearings to provide sound cues. The stumps are made of metal tubes and painted bright orange. Umpires and players use verbal prompts. For example, the bowler always shouts “Play!” while releasing the ball.	./Story text files/54.txt	3137	17	5.9077809798270895	284	63	120	32.03157894736842	75	20	20	6.71578947368421	68	27	158	189	5	1.292857142857143	385	35
"Meet Miss Bandicota Miss Bandicota Bengalensis was a little Indian mole rat who grew up in a maze of burrows with her mother, seven sisters and ten brothers. They were terrific pests, the nineteen of them, always out on a rampage. One night she was out foraging as usual, when suddenly, she heard an angry human voice. Quick and nimble, she just managed to escape from the farmer's scary grasp. As she was fleeing, she looked into the eyes of a mole rat stuck in a trap. Those were the saddest eyes she had ever seen.She was so terrified that she huddled in her mother's burrow all night, her eyes tight shut. In the early hours of twilight she announced to everybody's dismay that she would never attack a farm again. All her brothers and sisters tried to change her mind, but she would not budge. She soon became bored and restless and realised that she couldn't sit in that same old burrow any longer. She quietly packed her explorer's kit with her sunglasses, binoculars, magnifying glass and, of course, her favourite  a strip of sticker bandages.Her mother was worried. ""Whatever will you do? Whatever else can you do? "" Miss Bandicota Bengalensis smiled and said simply, ""I can burrow. "" So she burrowed and burrowed and burrowed and burrowed. But there was never a dull moment, for every burrow she dug went to some place new. And she would never need to attack a farm again.On the Seashore Somebody raised her tiny nose out of a hole in the sand. Who was that? Miss Bandicota Bengalensis! She had just emerged from a new burrow after a long night of digging through sand and clay. The sun was going to rise. Just as she was about to set her sunglasses on top of her nose, she caught a glimpse of the world above.In a flash she was washed back into her burrow. As she struggled to find solid ground, she yelled frantically, ""Help, help! The river has burst it's banks! "" ""There's no need to panic. This is the Arabian Sea, "" said a calm and reassuring voice drifting nearby. A baffled Miss Bandicota Bengalensis scrambled out on to the soggy sand. As she shook her dripping tail, she felt the soft, wet ground sinking slowly beneath her.She was looking down at her toes uneasily, when she noticed something bright and blue floating between her feet! ""You've reached the beach of Bordi, seventeen kilometres of fabulous sticky sand! "" it said.In a fraction of a second, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis had grabbed the magnifying glass from her kit. The very next moment, she was keenly examining the fascinating little creature, as it lingered on, quite unperturbed by this sudden intrusion. It was a strangelooking animal; a round body, silvery grey in the middle, surrounded by a turquoisecoloured ring and numerous translucent tentacles branching out radially.""Who are you? "" asked Miss Bandicota Bengalensis inquisitively. ""You can call us Porpita. We are a colony of polyps, "" it said, swimming by lazily. ""I'm Miss Bandicota Bengalensis. Whatever is. . . er. . . are polyps? "" As you might already know, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis could never resist asking a question. ""Sort of like a family, "" it answered. ""We live together and work in unison. Some of us breathe, eat; some of us taste or feel and some of us make little new polyps. ""Miss Bandicota Bengalensis was most intrigued. ""That doesn't sound like my family at all. We all live in our own burrows, collect our own food and make our own baby mole rats. "" ""How quaint! "" remarked Porpita, ""It must be quite tiring to be a mole rat. "" ""Not at all, we. . . glug glug glug. . . glug. . . glug. . . "" Poor Miss Bandicota Bengalensis swallowed a mouthful of sea water as she was knocked over by a large wave. ""Thoo. . . thoo. . . thoo, "" she spat out, wincing at the horrid taste of salt water. Almost immediately, she leapt towards the shore, dodging another quick wave.As the waves subsided, she turned around to ask Porpita yet another question. And stopped in wonder. Scores of sparkling polyps, just like Porpita, were gliding leisurely over the rolling waves. It was as if the night sky had gently dropped countless twinkling stars into a magical sea. Miss Bandicota Bengalensis stood mesmerised by the polyps that dipped and rose gently with the waves of Bordi. She bid them a silent farewell as they faded into the tranquil waters.""Deeper! Deeper! "" An eager voice shook Miss Bandicota Bengalensis out of her daydream. Her drowsy eyes fell upon a couple of human kids digging the sands of Bordi with funnylooking tools. From her last trip to Kaas Pathar, the plateau of flowers, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis had learned that not every human was a danger to mole rats. So she rushed in to play. ""Can I dig too? "" she pleaded anxiously, ""I love to burrow! ""The kids shrieked and bolted, flinging their beach toys away. Miss Bengalensis looked baffled. She had grown up running away from humans. This was the first time she had seen humans run away from mole rats! ""We're not all out to catch you, you know? "" she hollered after them. But the kids had long disappeared.Miss Bandicota Bengalensis looked at a bright green toy lying next to her feet. She picked it up and made a futile attempt to dig with it. 'No wonder humans can't burrow! ' she thought to herself. She dropped it and began to stroll down the lonely shore.Further down the beach, she came upon a peculiar sight. Tiny balls of sand were scattered around in puzzling patterns. It was as if the seashore was dotted with constellations. 'The mystery of the curious sand balls! ' thought Miss Bandicota Bengalensis. Her face lit up. Holding up her magnifying glass, she was lost in her investigation.Suddenly, she felt a small pinch at the tip of her tail. Swinging around, she spotted a crab looking up at her. ""No need to be nasty! I was just looking, "" Miss Bandicota Bengalensis said reproachfully, tucking her tail between her legs. ""Sorry about that! I was just going about breakfast when your tail came in the way, "" said the crab apologetically. ""Oh, never mind! Mole rats nibble all day too. I know what you mean, "" replied Miss Bandicota Bengalensis, for she happened to be a very forgiving mole rat.""I'm Mrs. Scopimera, "" said the crab. ""I'm Miss Bandicota Bengalensis. Do you know where these tiny balls of sand came from? "" ""Oh, those are just sand bubbles! We make sand balls like that when we suck our food in. """"And do you make them yourself or do you also have a family to help you, like Porpita? "" asked Miss Bandicota Bengalensis. ""Oh! You mean the polyps? I've seen them stick together in rings, bobbing in the water all day. We sand bubblers are nothing like them, "" she said proudly. ""We wander the beach sands, sometimes in pairs, sometimes alone. "" ""We do have large families though, "" she continued. ""My children must be down there, up to some mischief or the other. Would you like to play with them? "" she said in a friendly voice.A little Scopimera peeped out of a hole and called, ""Come on, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis. We're buildinga maze! Will you help us with the burrows? "" ""Burrows? I love burrows! "" Miss Bandicota Bengalensis sprang into the nearest hole, head first. Immediately, she was stuck! She was upside down in the sticky sand, her head in a hole and her legs sticking out in the air. Not one to lose heart easily, she threw her kit into the hole and promptly started burrowing to make a tunnel. The little sand bubbler crabs were thrilled. They had never seen anyone burrow so fast! They all began digging industriously, some sideways, some backwards, some upside down and some all around. In no time the seashore of Bordi was dug up into a secret maze. Miss Bandicota Bengalensis wanted to try out every new tunnel in it!Can you help Miss Bandicota Bengalensis get back to her travel kit through the secret maze? Miss Bandicota Bengalensis scurried excitedly through the underground maze at lightning speed. She finally reached her travel kit with shining eyes and a triumphant smile. She had never crossed so many new burrows in such little time!As she climbed out of the hole, she gasped in horror, ""The sea has vanished! "" She scampered around in circles, only to turn back again and again, ""Gone! Disappeared! "" As her eyes grew bigger and rounder in shock, more and more Scopimera kids clutched at their tummies and rolled in laughter. Poor Miss Bandicota Bengalensis!""There! There! It's just low tide, "" said Mrs. Scopimera kindly, coming to her rescue. ""It's just low what? "" asked a puzzled Miss Bandicota Bengalensis. ""Low tide. The sea water recedes during low tide and returns when the tide is high. Nothing to worry about, you know, it happens twice a day. That's when we sand bubblers get to eat. We have to rush into our holes again when the waves return. "" ""But where does the sea go? "" ""Just far, far behind. The water only seems to disappear over the flat and gentle Bordi sands. If you look hard enough, you will see a foamy white line. That's where the shore is now. ""Miss Bandicota Bengalensis fished out her binoculars hastily. Sure enough, she could see the waves of the Arabian Sea in the distant horizon. She heaved sigh of relief and collapsed on the sand. All that running around had made her very hungry and very thirsty. So she she began yet another journey, this time in search of food and water.Mrs. Scopimera accompanied her down the beach, up to the rows of casuarina trees. There, she wished Miss Bandicota Bengalensis luck and returned to her children. Miss Bandicota Bengalensis trotted ahead, along the edge of the beach. Her legs began to hurt. The tip of her tail, where Mrs. Scopimera had pinched it, was smarting.Always prepared, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis stuck her sticker bandage around her tail. The strong little mole rat walked steadily on, even as the rays of the sun beat down upon her. After what seemed like a zillion steps, she reached a sharp bend in the road.As the coast turned inwards, to her joy, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis discovered a charming grove of chickoo trees. The branches, laden with soft brown fruit, swung low. The orchard grounds were strewn sweet ripe chickoos.A farm pond lay nestled in the shadows of a hundred trees. Miss Bandicota Bengalensis first rushed to the edge of the pond and drank to her heart's content. Now refreshed, she dashed around the trees, madly gathering a heap of chickoos. She made a heap any self respecting mole rat would be proud of!Pleased with the morning's work, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis leaned back to admire the most alluring pile of fruit she had ever seen. Her greedy fingers couldn't wait to poke into the soft ripe skin. Her greedy toes couldn't wait to jump on the pile. Nobody saw the very hungry mole rat pounce on the chickoos.But before long. . . A busy honey bee was foraging around in the afternoon, when she came upon an enormous pile of black and beady chickoo seeds. A happy mole rat lay curled in a hole beneath it. ""A good worker works all day and sleeps only at night, "" muttered the honey bee. A very sleepy Miss Bandicota Bengalensis turned over and murmured, ""Sleep at night? No, no, no, not at all. Tonight, I must dig a new burrow. . . ""Bandicota bengalensis, also known as the Indian mole rat, is a giant rat of South Asia. It is not related to the true bandicoot. They can be up to  cm long, including the tail. They are seen as pests because they damage cereal crops and gardens. They make piglike grunts when attacking. The name 'bandicoot' is derived from the Telugu word pandikokku, which translates to 'pigrat'.Did you know that Porpita porpita is also called the 'blue button jellyfish'? But it is actually not a jellyfish at all! As you now know, it is a colony of many tentacleshaped animals. They all float together and eat through a single mouth in the centre of the button!Can you believe that the chickoo (scientific name: Manilkara zapota) is not from India? It came from faraway Central American countries like Mexico. The chickoo travelled across the oceans with adventurers just like Miss Bandicota to reach the shores of India, maybe about  years ago.The sand bubbler crab does not have lungs. So how does it breathe? It has 'gas windows' on its legs, through which it takes in oxygen. At high tide, the land crab depends on the air trapped in its burrows. At low tide, it emerges, to feed and make sand bubbles."	./Story text files/337.txt	12330	23	5.837262357414449	1021	294	171	51.92274678111588	114	119	28	10.399141630901287	100	133	760	555	7	1.5143237841439041	1258	243

Sister, sister, I wonder… What do you wonder, little brother, What do you wonder? I wonder, I wonder, why the sky is so blue. What do you think, little brother, What do you think? I think, I think… Tell me, little brother, what do you think?I think That maybe the sky Is really an upsidedown sea With cloudboats bobbing gently along. That an ENORMOUS sheet Of clear plastic skin Is stretched across that upsidedown sea To keep it in.And sometimes the plastic tears a little Here or there Like plastic will And then it rains. I think that is why the sky is blue Because it is a sea And seas are blue. I’m clever, aren’t I, sister?Oh yes you are, little brother, oh yes you are And maybe you are right, too. . . But in the books I have read That is not what they said. Then what did they say, sister, what did they say? What do you think, little brother, what do you think? I think, I think, Tell me, little brother, what do you think?I think That maybe the old woman Who lives in the sky Washes her ENORMOUS blue saree each night And spreads it out to dry in the sun Each morning.She is careful, the old woman She pins the saree down with cloudstones So that the naughty wind Cannot carry it away. I think that is why the sky is blue Because the old woman in the sky Spreads her saree out to dry. I’m clever, aren’t I, sister?Of course you are, little brother, And maybe you are right, too… But in the books that I have read That is not what they said. Then what did they say, sister, What did they say? What do you think, little brother, what do you think? I think, I think… Tell me, little brother, What do you think?I think That maybe, one longago Holi The shops ran out of every colour BUT blue. And I think, that day, Such an ENORMOUS cloud of blue dust rose From laughing blue people everywhere, That it reached up, up, up all the way To the sky.And the old woman, the one that lives up there, She scrubs the sky each day With cloudcottonwool, To get the stain out of the way. I think that’s why the sky is blue Because of a stubborn stain That drives the old woman insane. I’m clever, aren’t I, sister?Oh yes, you are, little brother, oh yes you are And maybe you are right, too… But in the books I have read That is not what they said. Then what did they say, sister, What did they say? What do you think, little brother, What do you think? They said, they said… Tell me, sister, what did they say?They said That there is a thick blanket of air Around our blue and green earth And that blanket is woven Of millions of little things they call Molecules.They said The air blanket is called Atmosphere. But why is the sky so blue, sister, Why is the sky so blue? Be patient, little brother, be patient now.They said The golden light from the glorious sun Is not golden at all But white! And what a white! A rainbowcoloured white!A violetindigobluegreenyelloworangered white. They said It is the RAINBOW light That comes to us Through the Atmosphere.But the sky is blue, sister, not violet or yellow or green! Listen, little brother, you'll see what I mean. Now the Molecules in the Atmosphere Well, they are not very fair.They let the red and the yellow and the orange light pass through Mostly And the green too But the blue! Oh, they give the blue a hard time! What do they do to the blue, sister, What do they do? Tell me, sister, what do they do?Well, when the sunlight strikes those Millions and millions of MOlecules They BOUNCE all that blue light The blue, blue light's Back where it came from; And the poor blue light Shatters, scatters All over, ALL OVER, the sky And turns it blue.Can it be true, sister, can it be true? I can’t say, little brother, I can’t say. But in all the books that I have read That is what they said.FIND OUT MORE! Why is the sky blue? Sunlight is made up of all the colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. The gas molecules in the atmosphere interact with the sunlight before it reaches our eyes. Each ‘colour’ of light is actually a different wavelength of electromagnetic radiation. Different wavelengths not only make up different colours, they also behave differently. Each of the different wavelengths in sunlight (or, in other words, each of the colours that sunlight is made up of) interacts differently with the molecules in the atmosphere. When sunlight strikes the molecules, they scatter the blue light (which has a shorter wavelength) more than they do the red, orange, yellow and green lights (which have longer wavelengths). Since the blue portion is scattered more, the sky appears blue.Try this experiment! Why does the sky appear orange and red at dawn and dusk? Let's try this exercise to find out. You need: A clear glass full of water A little milk A torch What to do: Shine the torch on the glass of water. Can you see the light in the water? Hardly. Now add a few drops of milk into the water. Then shine the torch again on the glass. This time, you will notice that the light is more visible. Add a few more drops of milk. Now you will notice that the light in the glass is distinctly blue.Why does this happen? When you add the first few drops of milk to the water, the number of molecules in the water increases. The fat and protein molecules in the milk scatter the light so that we can see it. When you increase the number of molecules by adding more milk, the light is scattered more, especially the blue light, which has a shorter wavelength.	./Story text files/373.txt	5447	36	5.8353174603174605	406	98	241	68.84615384615384	27	51	43	13.987179487179487	19	59	304	200	13	1.417562724014337	503	55

One day, an ant went looking for food. She found a sprouted green mung bean in the kitchen.The ant tried to pick up the green mung bean. It was very heavy. The ant then started to pull it to take it home. Her home was far away.On her way home, someone had left a tap open. Water was flowing from it. The tiny ant thought it was a river! Somehow, she crossed it. Her home was very far away.Then the ant saw a bucket. She held on to the green mung bean and tried to climb it. She tried hard but she kept slipping down.Soon another ant came up to her. They talked to each other. Now, they both went around the bucket while pulling the green mung bean.Further ahead, a woman was cleaning her house. Swoof! The ant fell to one side and the green mung bean fell on the other. The ant ran to get her green mung bean. Her home was still very far away.Next, the ant came close to a sleeping dog. The dog sneezed loudly! The green mung bean rolled off near the dog’s mouth.The ant carefully went near the dog. The dog opened one eye and looked at the ant. The ant took the green mung bean and began walking. Her home was very far away.Close by, a chick was pecking on some grains. It saw the green mung bean and tried to peck on it. Ah, now my green mung bean is gone, thought the ant sadly. Just then, the chick’s mother called out from under the papaya tree. Cluck! Cluck! Cluck!The chick left the green mung bean behind, and ran towards its mother. Once again, the ant picked up the green mung bean and started walking home. Her home was still. . . Oh, it was right in front of her now!Do you know your beans? The ant in this book found a green mung bean with a sprout. Sprouted beans are very good for our health. We can make sprouts with pulses like rajma, chickpea, black gram and horse gram. Bean Games Get to know the different kinds of pulses by playing this game with your friends. Ask an adult to give you different kinds of pulses from your kitchen, like chickpea, rajma, toor dal, soy bean, mung bean and peas and learn their names. Put them all in one bowl.

The sun had just dipped behind the coconut, mango and chiku trees that ring Appu’s house. The sky was still tinged with pink. The kitchen garden where the family grew brinjals, tomatoes and bottle gourd was still bathed in a soft light. Flocks of birds flew across the sky on their way home. Appu’s mother was making fish curry for dinner and wanted some fresh green chillies. Twelve year old Appu had gone to the garden to pick some fully grown, shiny green chillies when he was startled to hear a deep voice, “I am so glad your family likes my offerings.” Appu’s hair stood on end. He turned around to see who had sneaked up on him. The heavy but soothing voice seemed to come out of the kneehigh, leafy chilli plant. “Don’t be frightened, I am Ajar Uchu, known as the Spirit of Chillies,” it said.“You water the plants every evening and take care of them. I am so happy to be loved and admired. I am tens of thousands of miles away from home, and so your care means a lot to me.” Appu took a few moments to recover from the shock of hearing a voice from the plant. Appu asked, “Where do you come from?”“From very, very far, from the Americas. More precisely, from Mexico,” Ajar Uchu answered. Appu had no idea where Mexico was. Before he could ask for more details his mother shouted from the kitchen, “Appu, please bring the chillies in now.” Ajar Uchu said, “You have to go now, I suppose. Come back tomorrow and I’ll tell you more. But please don’t tell anybody about our conversation. I’ll tell you the story of our journey to India and all over the world.” Still dazed, Appu nodded and ran off. This little plant in the back garden came from faroff Mexico! “What took you so long?” Ma asked. Appu remembered what Ajar Uchu had said. “Oh. . . I spotted so many tomatoes that have grown on the plant since I last looked,” he said. He would learn later how the tomato plant too, had come from the same place as the chilli.Appu did not linger to taste the few pieces of fish that Ma had just fried. He ran off to his room and picked up the small globe that he had received on his last birthday. Impatiently, he turned the globe to see where South America was. It was on the other side of the globe. He quickly found the country that Ajar Uchu had mentioned: Mexico. Amazing! Appu thought. The next day seemed to drag for Appu. He went through his classes distractedly, finished his homework early in the evening with only one thought on his mind – the talking plant. Just before sunset he filled up the watering can and walked to the garden. He watered the egg plants, spinach, tomatoes and bottle gourd vines before coming to the chilli. Just after he had emptied the watering can on the chilli plants laden with bright green pods, some even turning red, Ajar Uchu spoke, “Ahh! So refreshing after a hot day! Thank you Appu.” Appu eagerly knelt down to listen to the story.“Thousands of years ago,” Ajar Uchu recounted, “Inca gods reigned over the vast mountains and forests that lay over South America. They sent four brothers to help the people who lived there. The Inca people grew maize, potato, avocado, tomato and many other fruits and vegetables.” Ajar Uchu was one of the brothers sent by the gods to ‘pepper up’ the life of the people. His spirit inhabits the chilli plants which became one of the most loved of the fruits. “Yes,” the voice told Appu, “chilli is actually a fruit, even though you may think of it as a vegetable. Although it is not sweet like other fruits, it produces seeds from which new chilli plants grow. That way the spirit of Ajar Uchu continues to live. Chilli became very popular as a condiment to spice up the region’s bland food of corn flour and potatoes. The kings demanded that Aztec and Inca people pay tribute with a supply of ripe and dried chillis.” “What is a tribute?” Appu asked. “It’s a kind of tax people pay to the king,” Ajar Uchu explained.Aztec and Inca Empire In what is now Mexico there was an older civilization created by the Aztecs. They spoke a common language – Nahuatl. Some  years ago they organized themselves into an empire. They had developed a rich agriculture growing corn, chilli pepper, avocado and other fruits. They also grew fine cotton to weave beautiful clothes and had plentiful gold to make jewelry. In the middle of a lake they built Tenochtitlan, their capital city. The Spaniards conquer the Aztec capital of TenochtitlanFurther south on the Andes mountains (today’s Peru) lived another people – the Incas – who worshiped the sun god, and believed one of his sons was Ajar Uchu. They built a large empire that eventually extended almost down to the southern end of South America. The powerful Inca kings collected tribute from the people in gold and produce like chillies, and as labour. The Incas did not know how to make wheels, yet they built ,  miles of roads! They carried heavy stones to build large monuments, rolling them on logs. Maybe they did not need wheels for carts as they had no horse or buffaloes to pull them – they had only goatlike llamas as pack animals. Aztec Maya Inca Map of AztecInca empire to the left. Map not to scale.“All this is interesting,” Appu interjected, “but how did you travel from your country to India?” On the globe, Appu had noticed the vast oceans and the African continent that separated India from Mexico. The voice said, “That’s a long story. The foreigners who came to our ancestral land and helped to take the chilli plant all over the world actually came there looking for a way to get to India. One day, over five hundred years ago, three sail ships sent by the King and Queen of Spain showed up in our neighborhood. Led by an Italian captain named Christopher Columbus, they had crossed the Atlantic Ocean hoping to find a shorter route to India. They had no idea that the huge American continents and the Pacific Ocean stood in the way.” “Why did they want to come to India?” Appu asked. Ajar Uchu chuckled, “Because India was the place that grew pepper, what you call kali mirch, and Europeans loved to season their food with it. Columbus, in fact, had brought some kali mirch with him to show people what he was looking for. He was convinced that he had reached India and he called Aztec, Inca and other local people he met Indians.”“Oh, that’s who the Red Indians are!” Appu exclaimed, surprised and pleased at his own discovery. “Columbus was very disappointed that those Indians had no black pepper to sell. But they showed him varieties of chilli that people grew. He tasted them and found they were as pungent as Indian pepper. He called that tiny fruit chilli pepper and stuffed his bags to take it back to Spain,” said Ajar Uchu. Appu was amused by the thought that Columbus came to look for kali mirch and took home hari mirch and lal mirch instead! Christopher Columbus meets the ‘Indians’!The next day Appu greeted Ajar Uchu after watering the plants. Appu was thrilled when he said, “Ah! I must tell you more about the Age of Discovery.” That sounded almost as exciting as a new computer game! Dimly a large map of the world began to take shape and the countries of Portugal and Spain and their ocean ports began to glow. “The Europeans’ love for Indian pepper,” Ajar Uchu explained, “goes back two thousand years. As early as the time of the Roman empire, wealthy people loved to spice their meat dishes with fragrant pepper. And they were willing to pay a high price for a few grams of the spice. Courageous Arab and Greek sailors set out for Kerala across the Arabian Sea to buy black pepper in exchange for other goods and gold coins and made a large profit reselling them to the rich people in Europe.”European Empires Europeans had long enjoyed spices imported from India by the Arabs. The Portuguese and Spaniards developed seaworthy boats and navigational tools that made it easier for them to sail the open ocean and they set out for India by going through the Atlantic. United Kingdom British Dominions France Portugal Spain Netherlands Belgium United States Map of the world’s empires in . Map not to scale.Christopher Columbus ended up in America () and Vasco da Gama in India (). They set up trading posts and then gradually colonized entire countries through power of arms and cunning. Greedy for territories rich in agricultural and mineral resources, the British, Dutch, Belgians, French, Danes and Italians also started carving up the world into colonies. To avoid conflict among Christian countries, the Pope even drew an imaginary line on the globe allowing Spain and Portugal to take control of land on either side of the line. The line was ignored when the British and Dutch joined the fray. Until India won independence in , India was the crown jewel of the British colonial empire. Christopher Columbus lands in the Caribbean island of San SalvadorThe Roman Empire From a small city state founded near today’s Italian capital, Rome, an empire grew through conquests and ruled a vast territory for nearly  years. The Roman empire had people of many ethnicities and languages as its citizens. One Roman emperor was even of African origin. Peaceful and organized civilian life was made possible by an elaborate legal system. The Roman Empire spread around the Mediterranean Sea,  CE. Map not to scale.The wealth created by taxes was used to maintain a large army and for luxuries for the ruling class. Many imported items like Chinese silks and Indian spices were most popular. Many imported items like Chinese silks and Indian spices were most popular. After the Roman Empire spread to today’s Egypt, trade with India blossomed. Large amounts of gold and silver coins were sent to India to buy spices. The importance of spices for a luxurious life can be seen by the silver pepper pots the Romans used to store precious pepper. A special spice market was built in Rome, and the city’s most fashionable street was named Pepper Street. Why were the Europeans crazy about pepper? The ordinary round grains of black pepper that people buy at the village grocer’s shop for a few rupees were sold for kilograms of gold. Why? “It was the rarity of the item,” said Ajar Uchu. Traders brought it from a very far and mysterious land. They traveled for months across the perilous ocean and then on camel caravan across vast deserts. Pepper not only made the food tastier, they found it also had medicinal value. Most importantly, pepper was the most precious commodity that you could use to show people how rich you were. Kings and aristocrats put small quantities in dainty little satin bags and gave them away as party favours. So, when Columbus promised the Spanish king that he would make him the ‘Lord of the Spices’, it meant he would be recognized as a very wealthy monarch.But with the rise of the large Islamic Ottoman Empire in eastern Mediterranean which controlled the trade routes to India, Europe’s pepper lovers were at a disadvantage. By the th century, shipbuilders had learned how to build sturdier ships which could take better advantage of wind on their sails. The knowledge of oceans too had grown. But still the vast body of water and what remained on the other side was a mystery. Silver pepper potsThe Ottoman Empire Inspired by Islam, a nomadic Turkic speaking people from Central Asia under the leadership Osman Bey, set out to conquer land from the nonMuslims. His successor Mehmed II, led a victorious army to capture Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine empire in . In subsequent centuries, the Turkish Ottoman (the name emerged from the founder Osman) empire emerged as the biggest Islamic empire, covering territory from northern Mediterranean to Egypt and Yemen. The Ottoman capture of ConstantinopleAlthough devout Muslims, the Turkish sultans employed experts from different religions to build a strong economy. The Turkish army developed an elaborate marching band using bass drums, triangles and cymbals – instruments that were incorporated into Western classical music and even inspired Mozart. The Turkish army also unwittingly introduced Europeans to coffee when they left sacks of coffee bean while abandoning their siege of Vienna. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the Western classical music composerSeafaring, compass, boat building Europeans were compelled by the rise of the Ottoman empire to find a different route to India and by this time their knowledge about the ocean and navigation technology had grown. The Portuguese, who were pioneers in seafaring had developed better maps and astronomical knowledge enabling them to sail down Africa’s Atlantic coast. They hoped to make it to Kerala, the land of spices, across the Indian Ocean from the tip of Africa. Previously, Indians and Arabs made boats by sewing planks of teak with coir. Arab sailors discovered how to ‘tack’ against the wind using triangular lateen sails. Europeans also learned from the Chinese the use of the rudder to manoeuvre a boat. Astrolabe, a instrument that helped sailors to navigate on the high seasTo navigate without sun, moon or stars the Portuguese developed a fine mariner’s compass from a crude magnetic compass originally invented by the Chinese. Europeans also developed the astrolabe to more accurately gauge their position in the high seas. As they sailed, guided by the compass, they reeled out long ropes with knots at a specific distance to measure how far and fast they moved. That is why to this day, steam and dieselpowered boats still measure their voyages in knots rather than miles or kilometre.“Imagine going out with a torch on a dark night,” Ajar Uchu said. “When you switch on the light it shows you a few feet of the road and dimly lights whatever is on both sides. But beyond the narrow circle of light everything is dark and unknown. That is how the sailors felt when they set out on the open ocean. Over the years map makers stitched together such narrow views gathered by seamen to give a bigger picture.There were more areas marked as unknown than known. Apart from not knowing what lay ahead, sailing in the ocean was full of risks. In a storm, the waves were taller than a threestoreyed building and could easily swallow the ships. And they often did. Thousands of men drowned or were shipwrecked. And yet they never stopped trying to cross the seas to find what was on the other side. Why? There was no shortage of moneyed men either who would take the gamble of paying for such adventures. They hoped that the spices or gold or silver that the returning sailors brought with them, would bring them more money than they spent. The Europeans, especially Spaniards and Portuguese monarchs wanted to benefit from the lucrative trade by sailing directly to India. The Portuguese tried to go down south along the Atlantic coast of Africa and find a way to head east towards India. The attempt to find a route to the spices and riches of India led to dozens of shipwrecks and loss of thousands of lives. But in the end, these attempts brought the Portuguese sailor, Vasco da Gama, to India.” “You already know about a ship captain from the Italian city of Genoa, Christopher Columbus. He reasoned that since the earth was round if he journeyed west on the Atlantic pushed by seasonal winds he could reach Japan and India pretty quickly. Apart from the total ignorance of the land that lay on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, Columbus made a serious miscalculation which proved very fortunate. Columbus made a wrong calculation about the size of the earth,” Ajar Uchu said.“He thought it was much smaller than it actually is. If he had known the real distance between Europe and the Asian continent he might have given up the attempt. To be on the sea to cover a huge distance would not only require more food and water but also a larger crew and a much bigger ship. Columbus finally convinced the Spanish Queen, Isabella, that the journey to Asia across the Atlantic would be shorter than the route the Portuguese were trying. With her blessing and money, in the spring of  Columbus set out in a convoy of three small ships – Santa Maria, Nina and Pinta to an unknown destination. After several weeks of sailing south west on what seemed to be an endless ocean the crew was getting worried about food and water. Finally on a moonlit night, the sailor who kept watch from the top of the tall mast, cried, “Land, land!” In the morning grateful sailors landed on a territory that no Europeans had set foot on before.They were met by curious people wearing no clothes, speaking a language that nobody understood. This was San Salvador, a Caribbean island, but Columbus was certain he had reached India. He thought the people who met them at the shore were obviously Indians. “The one who actually reached India, six years after Columbus’s voyage,” Ajar Uchu continued, “was Vasco da Gama. He led a Portuguese fleet commissioned by the King of Portugal. Four vessels and  sailors under his command rounded the tip of Africa and their ten month long journey ended in Calicut. That was the right place to get pepper!” (Route of Vasco da Gama’s first voyage to India,  to . Map not to scale. )“Vasco da Gama asked King Zamorin of Calicut, ‘Will you let me take some pepper plants away to my country? ’ Zamorin smiled and said, ‘Yes, you can take some plants but you won’t be able take our sun and rain. ’ The Portuguese soon found out the truth of those words. Instead of importing pepper, the Portuguese settled in India, capturing Goa from a local ruler in . Goa was soon turned into a great trading post shipping tons of pepper to Europe. The King of Portugal and not that of Spain became the Lord of Spices.” “In a twist of fortune another Portuguese captain trying to reach India was blown off course by winds in the south Atlantic and landed in the eastern coast of South America. The land was called Brazil. The place was turned into a Portuguese colony and Brazil proved to be the source of many new food items that were introduced to India.While large sailing ships left Goa for Lisbon loaded with pepper, cloves, cinnamon and other spices, the Portuguese started bringing in to India a variety of new kinds of fruits, vegetables and animals from South America. Brazil not only had chilli and other new produce, the Spaniards found they also had new products like pineapple, cashew nut – called caju – and rubber trees. Soon the ships full of produce from Brazil left for the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, to be transferred to ships that left for their long journey to Goa. (Vasco da Gama reaches India)One of the names for chilli in Goa was ‘Pernambuco pepper’ after the Brazilian port from which the shipment of chilli arrived.” Ajar Uchu paused and then said dramatically, “Goa! That was the world’s gateway to India.” Goa glowed brightly and Appu closed his eyes as he imagined the bustle at the sea port with many ships and sailors in different outfits! “When chilli seeds arrived in Goa they were snapped up by traders,” laughed Ajar Uchu, seeing Appu’s face. “It added so much flavor and taste to the food that the hot chilli peppers were passed from hand to hand. They spread all over western India and were known a Govaimirchi. It did not take long for different varieties of chillies – long, round, fat and stubby and of different colors – to spread all over India and Sri Lanka. Since there was active sea trade between Bengal and Sri Lanka chilli might have reached there from Sri Lanka. Maybe that’s why the Bengalis call chilli lanka,” mused Ajar Uchu. “But did the chilli just stay in India? No, it traveled westwards! Traders took chilli to Central Asia and Turkey and to Hungary. In Hungary a new variety of chilli called paprika was developed. It became Hungary’s favorite cooking ingredient making Hungarian paprika famous.” “So, one of the earliest wild plants to be domesticated by humans in far away Mexico nearly ,  years ago became such a basic ingredient that a Spanish priest in the th century wrote, ‘Without chilli, Mexicans do not believe they are eating. ’ It spread to so many other parts of the world,” said Ajar Uchu.In this way, Goa became an exciting place of discovery! Every two weeks Emperor Jahangir sent an official from his court to Goa to check on any new product that might have arrived from the ‘New World’, as North and South America came to be known. On one visit the official brought back pineapples and a strangelooking bird – a turkey. Jahangir’s court painter was ordered to paint these strange items. At the order of the Emperor a special garden was set up in Agra to grow pineapples for the palace. The original Brazilian name for the pineapple was ananas and that is how it was known in Agra too. Potatoes which grew only in Peru in South America were also introduced to the Mughal kitchen. When the British ambassador, Sir Thomas Roe, was entertained to a banquet by the palace, the main dish was made of the new root vegetable – potato. The ambassador who had never tasted such a vegetable before, was charmed.In a country where a large number of people are vegetarian, the arrival of new produce like corn, tomato, okra, red beans, sweet potatoes, peanuts and avocado proved a great boon. Not only vegetables but a whole new range of fruits also made their appearance. Papaya, litchi, guava, custard apple, chiku or sapota (its original name in Mexico is Chicosapotee) added to India’s already rich and varied food basket. (Traders at a Goan port)“Foreigners must also have taken things that grew here,” reasoned Appu. “Of course,” said Ajar Uchu. “Europeans’ craze for Indian pepper initiated the search for new sea routes. And once they reached here the Portuguese found the irresistible mangoes and coconuts and planted them in Brazil. Now mango is a major summer fruit in Brazil and Mexico.”“But, long before the Portuguese landed here, India supplied another crop that made its way to the Caribbean Islands and South America and made them rich. That was sugarcane. Sugarcane was brought into India a long time ago from Southeast Asia and Indians developed ways of turning the cane juice into sugar. Chinese Buddhist monks who came to India in the seventh century were intrigued by what they called ‘sweet rock’. China’s powerful emperor Taizhong sent an embassy to the court of Emperor Harshavardhan requesting him to send craftsmen who could teach the Chinese how to make sugar. Along with some Buddhist monks, two sugar makers travelled to China to introduce sugarcane and sugar making. Sugar was one of the key items of Indian export to the Middle East. Arab traders took sugarcane and introduced it as a crop in the island of Cyprus in the Mediterranean. Europeans loved sugar so much that the Spaniards saw a great business opportunity. They forcibly took slaves from Africa and developed huge sugar plantations and exported sugar all over the world.” Appu was intrigued by the thought. “So we gave South America sugar in return for chilli!” he exclaimed. As the sun reddened the sky and Appu knew that Ma would call him soon, Ajar Uchu ended by saying, “You can see how our lives, and the food we eat are connected to the rest of the world. Foods travelled without passports! The world is tied together by the foods we eat.”Appu’s mind was racing back to the evening he first heard the voice of Ajar Uchu. Indeed in his own backyard they grew not only chilli and tomato but also chiku and papaya. Thanking Ajar Uchu for being his secret friend with the most amazing stories, Appu went straight to his room, took out a sheaf of paper and with his crayons he wrote in large letters ‘Vishwa bagicha’  the garden of the world. He took it down to show his mother saying that he wanted to hang that on the gate of the garden. Ma was surprised. “Why?” she asked. “It’s a long story. I’ll tell you tonight when Baba comes home,” smiled Appu.	./Story text files/154.txt	23812	22	6.01340373679935	1937	525	274	87.8544776119403	61	207	45	16.574626865671643	48	220	1253	1209	6	1.6859778597785977	2218	492

His human worked most of the day, so they could only play late in the afternoon.In the big house next door lived a little girl and her two spotty dogs. One morning when Black Dog’s human left for work, he heard the little girl laughing. “It would be fun to have someone to play with,” Black Dog sighed. So, he started to bounce. He bounced . . . and bounced . . . and bounced . . .. . . until he bounced so high that he landed in the little girl’s garden. At first Black Dog had loads of fun.But then the little girl started pulling tails and twisting ears. “This is no fun!” Black Dog yelped. So he started to bounce. He bounced . . . and bounced . . . and bounced . . .. . . until he bounced so high that he landed back in his own garden. In the big house on the other side lived an old lady with a little yellow dog. “I’m sure she won’t pull my tail or twist my ears. It would be great to play with her,” sighed Black Dog.So he started to bounce. He bounced . . . and bounced . . . and bounced . . . . . . until he bounced so high that he landed in the old lady’s garden.At first, the lady scratched Black Dog behind his ears and rubbed his tummy. But after a while, the old lady sat down in her rocking chair and Black Dog got really bored. Ya a a a a a w n . . .So he started to bounce. He bounced . . . and bounced . . . and bounced . . .. . . until he bounced so high that he landed in his own garden again. When Black Dog’s human came home she didn’t pull his tail or sit in a chair scratching his ears.They played his favourite game and she told him how much she’d missed him all day long.“I love her and she loves me.

"School is closed for summer. Every day Chanda, Tinku and Motu have a new plan up their sleeves. Some days they trek to the nearby hill. On other days, they play hide andseek in the caves behind the house. They plan to go stargazing tonight.But right now, they are off to Chanda’s Ma and Baba’s laboratory. Chanda’s parents are agricultural scientists. Sharma Kaka, who is also a scientist at the laboratory, lets them in.“Motu, please be as quiet as a mouse,” says Chanda. Tinku looks around—huge books, rice saplings, laboratory equipment.Chanda spots a magnifying glass and hands it to Tinku. He peers into it and his eyes become BIG. “Ooooh, how does Motu’s nose look five times its actual size?” asks Tinku. “A magnifying glass has a powerful lens that makes small objects look bigger, and helps us see them clearly,” says Chanda.“Does that mean the magnifying glass can help me look at all kinds of small things? Like ants and sugar and even those germs Ma says live in my teeth,” says Tinku. “You can definitely see ants and sugar and all the jeera golis you drop while eating them. But to see germs, you need an even more powerful instrument called a microscope,” says Chanda.“Micro means very small. Does it make small things look very big?” asks Tinku. “Yes, Ma works on the microscope all the time. Come, let me show you.”Tinku is fascinated with how the microscope looks. The magnifying glass has just one lens; the microscope uses a combination of lenses to make things look really large. “We can see what our hair is made of, what leaves are made of and even what makes up our blood! When we give our blood sample for testing at the laboratory, the pathologist looks through the microscope and tells us which bacteria or virus is making us sick,” says Chanda.“Didi, when I want something small to look bigger, I can use a magnifying glass. When I want something even smaller to look bigger, I can use a microscope,” says Tinku. “But what can I use when I want to see something that is far away and looks tiny?” “You can use a pair of binoculars or you can use a telescope,” says Chanda.“Doesn’t Salim Mamu use binoculars when he goes to watch birds?” asks Tinku. “Yes, he uses binoculars. He doesn’t want to disturb the birds by going too close to them! I have Baba’s old pair of binoculars, let’s see what it can do.”“All I see is blue!” says Tinku. Chanda laughs. ""You are looking at the sky! Little by little, bring your hands down. Sloooowly.”“I can see a bird pecking at something! But if I move my hand even a little, it goes away.” “That is because its lenses are very powerful. Even a slight movement of your hands will completely change the view from your binoculars,” says Chanda.That night, Chanda and Tinku return to the laboratory to go stargazing. “The scientists have arranged for a telescope from the nearby planetarium. I will show it to you,” she tells Tinku.Standing on the terrace, his eyes fixed to the telescope, Tinku says, “Saturn looks just like the drawings in our school books. We can’t see it like this without a powerful telescope.”“Yes, some telescopes are as large as huge houses and are powerful enough to show us galaxies far away,” says Chanda. Tinku gazes at the starburst sky and asks, “Didi, do you think that people from other planets are looking at us through their telescopes too?” Chanda grabs the telescope and searches for aliens.What Do You See? Magnifying glasses and microscopes help us see small things clearly. Binoculars and telescopes help us see faraway objects better. All have one or more lenses. A lens is a piece of glass or some other seethrough material that is curved on one or both sides. As light moves in a straight line, lenses help to bend it in such a way that when it reaches the eye, the object seen through the lens can look bigger or smaller than it really is."	./Story text files/62.txt	3841	16	5.954887218045113	314	85	180	60.96774193548387	25	37	38	12.0	20	42	244	155	5	1.5434298440979954	388	61

I think, I think Tell me, little brother, What do you think?I think That there is a great big Kumbhakarna Sleeping in the sky And when the silver ropes of rain Lash him, and chase his sleep away, He wakes up. Sparks fly out of his eyes like lightning He stamps his big ugly feet Takes a long deep breath And ROARS with rage.(Let me tell you If I had thrown a tantrum like that Mother would have spanked me. Hard. ) I think that’s Where the thunder comes from From the fury of a Kumbhakarna in the sky Who likes to stay asleep, and dry. I’m clever, aren’t I, sister?Oh yes you are, little brother, oh yes you are. And maybe you’re right, too… But in the books that I have read That is not what they said. Then what did they say, sister, What did they say? What do you think, little brother, What do you think? I think, I think… Tell me, little brother, What do you think?I think There is a gang of crazy bikers Up there in the sky In their black leather jackets And steelstudded boots And dark glasses that hide their eyes Just like in the movies. And what they like to do best Is to race each other in the pouring rain.I think When they mount their bikes and KICK them to life Steel strikes steel There’s your lightning! Then, when they do what bikers do Rev up their engines, and rrrev them, and rrrev them There’s your thunder!I think that’s where the thunder comes from Not from a demon, not from a plane, But from a fleet of bikes that race in the rain. I’m clever, aren’t I, sister?I know you are, little brother, I know you are And maybe you’re right, too… But in all the books that I have read That is not what they said. Then what did they say, sister, What did they say? What do you think, little brother, What do you think? I think, I think… Tell me, little brother, What do you think?I think That when it rains The children Of the old woman in the sky Are absolutely NOT allowed To play outside (for they may catch a cold! ). Cooped up indoors They all get a little restless, and VERY cranky.I think the old woman opens her trunk Pulls out a game of chaupad And a pair of giant dice. The children clap their hands in excitement Roll the giant dice And forget they were ever bored. I think that’s where the thunder comes from From the dance of a pair of dice As they make their way across the skies. I’m clever, aren’t I, sister?Of course you are, little brother, And maybe you’re right, too… But in all the books that I have read That is not what they said. Then what did they say, sister, What did they say? Come here, little brother, I’ll tell you what they said. They said, they said… Tell me sister, what did they say?They said That thunder always comes after lightning. But you know that, don't you? And that It is the lightning That makes the thunder.The lightning is like ELECTRICITY The same magic ELECTRICITY That runs the pump And floods the house with light And fills the TV with Sachin and Saurav At the flip of a switch. But I asked about thunder, sister, I asked about thunder. Have patience, little brother, Have patience now.They said that lightning is very hot Just like electricity. And when it slices through the air And stabs the earth It makes the air through which it comes Very Very Very hot. They said The hot air EXPANDS And explodes BOOOOOOM! Like a monster Diwali bomb.And some little children Bury their faces In their mothers’ sarees. But brave little boys like you Hear the air go BOOOOOOM! Turn around quickly. Can it be true, sister, can it be true? I can’t say, little brother, I can’t say. But in all the books that I have read That is what they said.FIND OUT MORE! Where does thunder come from? Everything around us is made up of tiny particles called atoms. Each atom has a nucleus at the centre, which is filled with particles called neutrons and positively charged particles called protons. Even tinier particles (negatively charged) called electrons go around the nucleus like the planets go around the sun. In a thundercloud, air carries bits of ice and water droplets upwards. When they rub against each other, the atoms in them become ions (that is, they become charged positively or negatively). The positive ions are lighter and move upwards, while the heavier negative ions move downwards to the bottom of the cloud.The negative ions at the bottom of the cloud attract the positive ions on the earth. When they start flowing towards each other, electricity is created, which becomes a huge, powerful flash of lightning. The lightning makes the air around it very, very hot almost as hot as the sun! This hot air expands very quickly, causing a big explosion. It then begins to contract equally quickly once the lightning flash has passed. This explosion of air is what causes the sound waves that we call thunder.Try this experiment! To understand how particles with opposite charges attract each other, let’s make a magic ‘magnetic balloon’! You need: A balloon A piece of wool or silk A wall What to do: . Blow up the balloon. . Rub it briskly with the piece of wool or silk. . Hold it against the wall and watch it ‘stick’ there like a magnet to iron! Why does this happen? When you rub the balloon with the wool or silk, electrons get transferred between the two. The atoms in the balloon take in more electrons, so the balloon becomes negatively charged. When you hold it against the wall, the negative ions in the balloon get attracted to the positive ions in the wall, causing the balloon to stick to the wall!	./Story text files/15.txt	5660	13	5.696363636363636	448	102	175	68.03658536585365	25	57	34	13.707317073170731	21	61	330	220	5	1.4114754098360656	563	47

"The drum has always been an important musical instrument in our community. We love drums! We have drums of different sizes: big, mediumsized and small.We play drums using beaters, or with our fingers. We play drums for various reasons. We play drums with songs and dances, for feasts and in bad times.Drums enrich songs and make people want to dance. Drums make ceremonies colourful. We play drums during ceremonies for marriage and child naming. We play drums when celebrating a new harvest or a twin birth.We sound drums to announce grief and call people when death occurs.We sound drums to call people to clean wells, clear roads, or to build a hut for a needy old person. We sound drums to call people when cattle are stolen in our village.We sound drums to gather people for meetings at our chief's palace.Drums call people to go to church for prayers on Sundays, and other prayer days. We also play drums to enrich songs when singing in churches.The big drum sounds, ""An a bul mba, an a bul mba, an a bul mba mbambamba bul.

Mukhil has been in bed all day. She has a fever. She’s really tired but her head is buzzing with questions. Will Amma let her miss tomorrow’s maths test? Will she be too tired for playtime with friends? And when did her room get so cold?Amma comes in with a bowl of rice kanji. COUGH! COUGH! COUGH! Amma looks worried and takes her temperature. “ degrees! Oh no!” Mukhil’s body is so warm, but she feels so cold! “Maybe we should take a blood test,” says Amma.Mukhil sits up in alarm. A blood test? “But I have not studied for any tests!” “It’s not that kind of test,” Amma laughs. “The doctor will take a little of your blood to look at it under the microscope.”“But what if all my blood drips out and I end up empty?” Mukhil asks. She is terrified. “Don’t worry,” says Amma. “An adult has at least five litres of blood in their body. You’re a child and even you will have at least three litres! That’s almost  teaspoons of blood. The doctor will just need a few drops.”As Mukhil dozes off that afternoon, she sees a ghost in a long white coat getting ready to suck her blood. What long teeth it has! Mukhil wakes up cold and shivering. Phew! It's only a dream!In the evening, Amma and Mukhil go to a clinic. Mukhil sees a nurse coming towards her with a long rubber cord. “Is he going to tie me up?” she yells.The doctor laughs, “No, no. This is a tourniquet. Here, sit down and curl the fingers of your left hand into a fist.” The nurse ties the tourniquet around Mukhil’s left arm. “The cord is just to help him draw the blood easily,” she says.Then, the nurse brings out a syringe saying, “This will only take a few seconds.” Mukhil jumps out of the chair when she sees the needle. “Oh Mukhil! You will need to be brave,” says Amma. So Mukhil climbs back in and shuts her eyes.The needle goes in. Ouch! Mukhil opens one eye to see the syringe filling up with blood. It is dark red, almost maroon. The nurse slowly pulls out the needle and presses a small piece of cotton to soak up a drop of blood. “Bend your arm at the elbow and hold it like that for a few minutes,” he says.“Is that all?” Mukhil asks the doctor, thinking that it wasn’t so bad. The blood is now in a small plastic tube. “That’s it! You can collect the results tomorrow,” replies the doctor, “The lab will check your blood to see if everything is alright.”On the way home, Amma buys some candied cherries for Mukhil. They are as maroon as her blood. Mukhil eats them all up.The next day, Amma brings home the blood test results. “Have I passed?” Mukhil asks in a worried tone. “Yes,” says Amma, “The doctor says it’s just a flu. You’ll be fine, soon!”Mukhil smiles. She is feeling better already. And she can't WAIT to tell her friends at school about how she passed her first blood test!Colourful Blood Human beings and many other animals have RED blood.

Sringeri Srinivas was having a very bad day. Nobody wanted the sweet, ripe bananas he was growing on his farm.Not his family. Not his neighbour. Not his friends.Not the traders who could sell the bananas in far away markets. And not even his cows!“No, thank you,” they all said. “The bananas are very sweet but we have had too many. We cannot eat any more!”Poor Sringeri Srinivas! What was he to do now with his rich harvest of bananas?He decided to seek help from the Farmer's Centre in Doddooru, a big town near his village.Off he went carrying the best crop of bananas. Surely someone there would have a good idea for him.A few days later, Sringeri Srinivas returned home looking very happy. He went back to growing bananas on his farm.But he did not offer the fruits to anyone anymore.Not to his family. Not to his neighbour. Not to his friends.Not to the traders who could sell the bananas in far away markets. And not even to his cows!Everyone became very curious. Where were all the bananas going?One day, neighbour Shivanna arranged a very big pooja.The priest asked him to get  ripe bananas as an offering to the gods.Shivanna ran to Sringeri Srinivas. “I’m sorry for saying no to you before, but now I need  ripe bananas. Can you help me, please?”Sringeri Srinivas tapped his chin. “Well, my crop has just been cut but let me see what I can do. You may start your pooja. I will surely come.”The pooja started. The whole village came to watch. The priest began chanting.Soon it became time to offer bananas to the gods.Just then, in came Sringeri Srinivas carrying a big bag.From the bag, he carefully took out  packets and laid them out before the holy fire. Each packet was carefully wrapped in banana leaf.On each one was written  “High Quality Banana Halwa, S. S. Farms.” Sringeri Srinivas offered one to the priest.“Each one has the pulp of  bananas. There are  packets. So here are your  ripe bananas!”The priest was so surprised that he forgot to chant. In the silence, one child began to laugh.Soon the whole village was laughing and clapping.Now we know what Sringeri Srinivas does with all the bananas that he grows!DID YOU KNOW? Facts About Bananas The word banana is derived from the Arabic word for ‘finger’. India is the largest producer of bananas in the world. There are over  edible varieties of bananas grown here. The National Research Centre on Bananas in Trichy has a collection of  banana varieties! Bananas are high in minerals that help increase brain power. Bananas make students more active and alert. Many Indian sweets are made out of bananas  Banana Payasam in Kerala, Banana Rasayana in Karnataka, Banana Halwa, Rawa Kela Gur Mithai.

One Day Mac was out in the garden chasing The Cat, when suddenly, something caught his attention. It was Dipper. She was digging at something by the fence. He bounded over to where she was busy with the fence to find out what was going on. “Whatcha doing Dipper?” Mac asked, sniffing at the fence where she was digging. “I think I found a hole!” Dipper announced proudly. “A hole?” questioned Mac. “Yes a 'hole',” Dipper replied enthusiastically. “What's a hole?” asked Mac. “Er – well, a hole is something that's not there.” replied Dipper.Mac thought about this carefully. What's the use of having something that's not there? He thought to himself. He paused, not wanting to seem stupid. Then, looking at Dipper studiously, he decided to ask anyway. “What's the big thing about something that isn't there?” he asked. “Well,” said Dipper, “when something isn't there, there is nothing to stop us going through.” “Going through?” said Mac, “Well, what is the point in going through?” Dipper looked dreamily into the distance, and paused a while before answering. She paused so long that Mac had almost forgotten what they were talking about, and had begun to wonder where The Cat was. . . .“If we go through, we can see what is on– The Other Side!” Dipper finally answered triumphantly. Mac, interrupted from his thoughts about the Cat, now wondered what the big deal was. Who cares what's on The Other Side, he thought, I've got all this nice stuff here. I don't want to go to The Other Side, why would I want to go to there? Dipper was young and inquisitive, and since she had found the hole she just couldn't keep her mind off finding out what was on. . . . The Other Side! The Other Side! The Other Side! The Other Side! “Yep – there's definitely a HOLE here,” said Dipper, “and if we go through, we'll be on – The Other Side!” . Dipper was fascinated, she couldn't go to The Other Side without someone with her, and then she could only go where they wanted her to go. What was the rest like? Why couldn't she go there, alone? What interesting things were out there on The Other Side? She wondered excitedly. Now here was her chance to find out!Mac did not like the look of the hole. He thought The Other Side was dangerous, and he didn't want to go somewhere dangerous. He had a bad feeling about it, after all, he thought, if it wasn't dangerous, why wouldn't he be allowed to go there? Mr and Mrs Smith looked after him, and if they didn't want him to go to The Other Side, there must be a good reason. Dipper was too young to reason so well, all she saw was that The Other Side was OUT THERE to be explored, and she wanted to go there!“Mac – I think I can get through here!” Dipper yelped. “Uh, I really don't think you should do that Dipper,” Mac woofed back. “Why not?” Dipper retorted, then quickly added “Don 't be silly Mac, you're scared of everything.” hoping Mac might forget to answer. “I am not!” Mac defended. “I just think there is a good reason why we can't go there.” “Yeah – well what is the reason?” Dipper asked.  “Uh, I dunno, but I uh. . .” Mac replied, he still had that bad feeling, but Dipper was too excited to notice. “Common, let's go!” Before Mac could stop her, she was through the fence and on The Other Side! The Other Side The Other Side The Other Side Mac didn't want to follow her, he thought she might not be brave enough to leave his sight if he stayed behind the fence. Then, something happened that made him rethink.A small black and white object darted across the road and disappeared behind some bushes, with two pairs of eyes following. The two dogs looked at each other, then back across the road, and then at each other again. “THE CAT!” They shouted together. Dipper started running towards where The Cat disappeared, while Mac began squeezing himself through the Dipper size hole. It took a bit of struggling, but before long he was through the hole and bounding across the road to look for The Cat. Dipper was rummaging around the bushes when he arrived. “Where's The Cat, Dipper? Where is she?” He snuffed, out of breath from the squeeze through the hole and the following chase. “She must be here somewhere, I know it,” said Dipper, furiously sniffing around. Mac joined her, and began furiously sniffing too. After a few minutes, their sniffing slowed, and then stopped. The started looking around, then they looked back at each other again. “She disappeared,” said Dipper. “ Yes – I know,” replied Mac, “she's gone.”Mac was about to say, “Let's go back, this is not right” , when Dipper interrupted his thoughts, “Look – over there, it's a small brown furry thing. What is it? Where's it going? ?” She didn't wait for Mac to reply but started running after the little creature. “Er – I think it's a 'SQUIRREL' Dipper!” He again forgot why he wasn't supposed to be out there and started running behind her. After all, squirrels could not be left alone  not if there was a chance to catch them! They darted and dived through the bushes, chasing the squirrel. Every time they got close the squirrel darted off again, but never far enough that they lost sight of his bushy tail. The chase went on for some time, until, finally. . . Just when they thought they had the squirrel cornered. . . He disappeared into hole, and, just like The Cat – he was GONE.Frumph. . . Mac sank down on his paws. Frumph . . . Dipper followed. “Mac – ” she called, “it's not too bad.” “Why's that – what do you mean it's not too bad? ? ?” Mac responded forlornly. “Well, we are on The Other Side now, we can explore and see what everything on The Other Side is!” Dipper explained. “But. . .” Mac tried to protest, he kept thinking there was something wrong with the situation, but he couldn't put his paw on it. Dipper started sniffing around and checking this way and that. There were so many new smells to sniff, and she wanted to check out all of them. Mac reluctantly looked on. Each time she found a new smell, it was a bit further away. Mac followed just close enough to keep an eye on her, always staying within woofing distance.Whenever she found a new smell, she called back to him.  “Mac – check over here, it smells like there were some other dogs here. . .” .  “Mac – this smells like sweet flowers. . .”  “Mac, there was some other animal here – maybe it's another squirrel. . .” Mac, still followed, not wanting her to get in trouble, but also not wanting to miss out on the action. Not quite brave enough to look himself, and not quite bold or scared enough to try to stop her, but too much of a friend to leave her alone and go back home. Mac might have been stuck in this dilemma for ever, had not something else happened.They came out of the bushes into a clearing, and Mac saw the sun. “Dipper – it's going to be dark soon! We can't be out here on our own in the dark.” Gruffed Mac. “Dark – it's not getting dark.” She replied. “Look at the sun!” Mac pointed to the fading yellow ball. Looking up, Dipper suddenly saw he was right. “Okay, I guess we could come back, some other time.” She was completely absorbed in the excitement and was worried they might never see these things again, the sun had not yet brought her back to reality.  “Let's go NOW Dipper!” Mac growled, as he was becoming very worried about their safety. They started back towards where they thought they had come from, quickly running through the bushes. As they ran the light grew dimmer and dimmer, and as the light grew dimmer they had to tread slower and more carefully to keep from tripping over branches and getting tangled on twigs. Still the light grew dimmer, and then it grew darker, and Mac got more and more worried.He knew it wasn't a good idea to be out here. “Mac – It doesn't look so much like where we came.” said Dipper timidly. “Er – no, it doesn't,” Mac rolled his big droopy eyes. What were they going to do? He decided to try not to look too miserable yet, for Dipper's sake. “It's okay, we'll find our way back, and we'll be warm and comfortable on the INSIDE soon. Inside, in the dog house, with our blankets and food bowls before you can say. . . .” Mac trailed off.  “Before you can say?” Dipper queried.  “Before you can say. . . .” Mac still couldn't finish what he was trying to say, he was worried they really might not get back. Dipper started looking about and sniffing. Now all the smells that had smelled so interesting, began to smell very scary. The sounds that sounded so interesting sounded haunted and spooky. The night was getting colder and chillier, she missed her blanket, and her bowl and her. . . .Mac suddenly remembered the reason why they shouldn't go out – because they might get lost! Not only that – all those spooky sounds didn't just sound spooky, they WERE spooky. And, worse still, they might get hurt. He started treading more and more cautiously, “Stay close to me Dipper.” he called. Mac also started thinking about home, with his warm blanket and his food. There was another reason they shouldn't have left, The Other Side didn't have any ready made food or blankets around. Why couldn't he remember all these things before they left? Better keep Dipper's spirits up, he thought, and turned his mind back to the task at hand. He tried to finish the sentence again “We'll be home before you can say. . . . . .” “ . . . . Before you can say. . . – There's THE CAT! ! !” Dipper looked up suddenly.He was right, it WAS The Cat! Just when Dipper had started to think she would never get home. The Cat would know how to find home. If they just kept her in sight, they would eventually find their way back. They didn't know how, but they knew The Cat never got lost. They stayed a short distance behind the cat, so she wouldn't run like she normally did when they chased her. Slowly but surely, things started getting more and more familiar, until finally they saw the fence again where they had first found the hole. But, the hole wasn't there anymore, someone had fixed it. Outside the gate, they could see Tyron calling: “Dipper. . . Mac. . . . . , where are you, Dipper. . . Mac. . .” He looked and sounded so worried. There was no sneaking in now. Mac remembered the other reason why they shouldn't go out.Mr Smith! Once inside, they both got smacked on their bottoms by Mr Smith for the naughty escapade, to make them never forget why not to go out, and then they were sent to bed without their supper.

Her chosen career is as a professional pilot, she has worked in a variety of aviation capacities from instruction to airline flying, and is the author of several aviation text books. Danielle started writing children's books as a creative outlet from the stress of her 'day job' and as a break from the sometimes monotonous work required for her professional writing. She began with the Mac and Dipper series, aimed at (cid:) year olds, inspired by two of her own dogs. After having a child of her own, she suddenly found she had a muse, an eager resource for test reading, and, by benefit of her age, an honest critic all in one, it was fun and rewarding to write creative stories which matched her daughters learning curve. A series of 'junior' books aimed at (cid:) year olds followed. Encouraged by friends and family, and already familiar with the self(cid:)publishing route through her non(cid:)fiction books, Danielle began publishing the books online so that others could also enjoy them too.

"The lion was the king of the jungle. Everyone shivered and shook when he roared.He had a terrible toothache since two days. “Maharaj, get this tooth extracted,” suggested the monkey, the jungle physician. “Alright,” agreed the lion.Who would extract the lion’s tooth? They were all terrified of him! “Maharaj, I will give you a kick with my hind legs. The tooth will pop out,” said the foolish donkey.“You will dare to kick the king?” roared the lion peevishly. The donkey tucked his tail between his legs and ran off.The elephant, cheetah, bear and deer were all worried. Who would stick their hand into the lion's mouth?Two days passed. The toothache was getting unbearable. “Should I take a look?” asked the mouse one night when the lion and he were alone. “Alright,” said the lion and opened his mouth wide.“Oh! There is a lot of dirt trapped between your teeth!” said the mouse taking a peek inside. Using his sharp teeth, he cleaned out the lion’s teeth. The lion felt much better.“Maharaj, please clean your teeth everyday, or else your teeth will rot,” said the wise little mouse.“Yes, you are right. But please don’t tell anybody or they will say their king doesn’t keep clean…” pleaded the lion.""Alright, "" laughed the mouse.The lion also laughed."	./Story text files/185.txt	1257	16	6.038461538461538	101	29	100	40.93333333333333	20	10	18	8.1	18	12	68	62	4	1.3071895424836601	138	15

"THUMP, THUMP, THUMP! The noise wakes up Unni and he looks out of the window. Some men are digging and hammering near his home. There are thick wires and wooden poles all around them. Unni wonders if they are building a new house in the forest.Unni finds Amma pressing his school uniform with a clothes iron full of hot coal. “Amma, who are these men working outside our home?” asks Unni. “You’ll find out soon. Now go and eat your idlis before they become cold,” replies Amma, with a mysterious smile.After breakfast, Unni pulls on his warm uniform. “Bye, Amma!” Unni hurries through the forest towards the coffee estate. His best friend Ammu lives here. There she is, waving at him! “Let’s race!” says Ammu. And off they go!The two friends zip through the coffee plants. They circle around the big mango tree. They hop across the stream. And finally, they reach the road that leads to school.Unni listens to Ammu humming a tune as they walk to class. It’s from her favourite cartoon show on TV. “The boy in the cartoon fights villains using his magic glasses!” she explains. Unni wonders when he will have a TV at home.TRINGGGGG!

It sounds like your home doesn’t have an electricity connection.” “But why?” asks Unni. Janaki Miss replies, “Electricity comes through wires from the village power station. Since you live deep in the forest, it is difficult for the wires to reach your home.” Unni is disappointed.After school, the two friends race back to Ammu’s home in the coffee estate. The sun is setting. Ammu turns on the tubelight. “I’m going to go study now,” she says. ""It's getting dark. Let me get home quickly. I need to light the kerosene lamp, "" says Unni, sighing.Outside their house, Unni sees his father talking to some men. It’s the men who made all that noise in the morning. “What is happening, Acha?” Unni asks.Everyone turns and smiles at him. Amma points to a switch on the wall. Unni presses the switch and. . . TA DA! THE ROOM LIGHTS UP! Everyone claps. This can only mean one thing. . . “I can’t believe it!” says Unni. “Our house finally has electricity!”Unni can now study under the tubelight, sleep under the fan, drink chilled lime juice, and finally watch the adventures of the superhero with magic glasses!Did You Know?

"Dhani knew something exciting was being planned at the ashram, but no one would tell him anything. “Just because I’m nine years old,” thought Dhani glumly. “I’m sure they think I’m stupid. I am not!” Dhani and his parents lived in a very special place. It was Mahatma Gandhi’s Sabarmati Ashram near Ahmedabad where people from all over India came to stay. Like Gandhiji, they were all fighting for India’s freedom. During their stay at the ashram, they spent their time spinning khadi thread on charkhas, singing bhajans and listening to Gandhiji’s lectures. At Sabarmati, everyone had to work – cook and clean, wash clothes, fetch water from the well, milk the cows and goats, and grow vegetables. Even Dhani had a job – he had to take care of Binni, one of the ashram’s goats. He quite enjoyed that because Binni was his best friend and he liked talking to her.That morning, as Dhani fed Binni with fresh grass and changed the water in her bowl, he said, “Something’s up, Binni! They all sit and talk in Gandhiji’s room. They are planning something. I know it!” Binni chewed and nodded as if she understood. Dhani felt hungry. He headed towards the kitchen, with Binni skipping along beside him. His mother was fanning the chulha, filling up the room with smoke. “Amma, is Gandhiji going somewhere?” he asked. His mother coughed in the smoke and said, “They are going on a march.” “March? Where are they going?” Dhani queried. “Somewhere near the sea. Now stop asking questions and go away Dhani!” his mother said impatiently. “Let me finish the cooking first.” Dhani wandered off to the vegetable garden where old Binda was digging up potatoes.“Binda chacha,” Dhani sat beside him, “are you going on the march too?” Binda shook his head. Before he could say anything, Dhani eagerly asked, “Who is marching? Where are they going? What is happening?” Binda stopped digging and said, “I’ll answer all your questions, but first tie up that troublesome goat. She’s chewing up my spinach.” Dhani dragged Binni away and tied her to the lemon tree nearby. Then Binda told him about the march. Gandhiji and some of the men from the ashram were going to walk through Gujarat to reach the sea at a place called Dandi. They would walk through villages and towns for a whole month. Once they reached Dandi, they would make salt.“Salt?” Dhani sat up and frowned. “Why will they make salt? You can buy it in every shop!” “I know,” Binda laughed. “But Mahatmaji has a plan. You know he always marches to protest against something, right?” “Of course I know. He leads the Satyagraha marches to fight the British government and win freedom for India. But why is he protesting about salt? It’s silly!” “It’s not silly at all, Dhani! Do you know we all have to pay a tax on salt?” “So what?” “Everyone needs salt. . . that means, every Indian, even the poorest, has to pay this tax,” explained Binda chacha. “That is really unfair!” Dhani’s eyes were hot with anger.“Of course it’s unfair. Not only that, Indians are not allowed to make any salt either. Mahatmaji has asked the British to stop the tax, but they have refused. So he has decided to walk to Dandi and make salt from seawater.” “Walking for a month!” Dhani brooded worriedly. “Gandhiji will get really tired. Why don’t they take a bus or train to Dandi instead?” “Because, if he goes on this long march and walks all the way to Dandi, the news will spread. There will be pictures in the papers and reports on the radio, and people all over the world will know that we are fighting for our freedom. And that will really embarrass the British.” “Gandhiji is clever, isn’t he?” Dhani’s eyes were shining. “Ah, that he is!” Binda’s eyes crinkled with laughter. “He’s even written to the Viceroy and told him what he plans to do! The British have no idea what they are in for!”Later in the morning, Dhani wandered up to the hut where Gandhiji was staying and peered in through a window. Inside, many of the ashram people were talking to Gandhiji. Dhani heard them planning the route along which they would walk to Dandi. He was thrilled to see his father sitting among the people. In the afternoon, when the ashram was quiet, Dhani went looking for his father. He found him under a tree, spinning on his charkha. “Pitaji, are you and Amma going on the march to Dandi?” Dhani got straight to the point. “I am going. You and Amma will stay here.” “I am coming with you.” “Don’t be silly, Dhani. You can’t walk so much. Only the ashram’s young men will go.”“I’m nine and I can run faster than you can!” Dhani replied stubbornly. “You can’t stop me from coming with you.” His father stopped spinning and explained patiently, “Only the people who have been chosen by Mahatmaji will go.” “Fine! I’ll talk to him then! I’m sure he’ll say yes,” said Dhani and marched off. Gandhiji was a very busy man and it was not easy to catch him alone. But Dhani knew exactly when he would have the time to listen – early every morning when he went for a walk around the ashram. The next morning, as the sun came up, Dhani slipped out of bed and went looking for Gandhiji. He found him in the cowshed checking on all the cows. Then he strolled into the vegetable garden to inspect the peas and cabbage and have a chat with Binda.All the while, Dhani and Binni followed him. Finally, Gandhiji headed back to his hut. He sat down beside his charkha in the verandah and called out to Dhani, “Come here, child!” Dhani ran up, with Binni skipping along. “What’s your name beta?” “Dhani, Gandhiji.” “And this is your goat?” “Yes, Gandhiji! This is my friend Binni, who gives the milk you drink every morning.” Dhani smiled proudly and said, “I take care of her.” “Good!” Gandhiji leaned forward. “Now Dhani, tell me why you and Binni have been following me everywhere this morning?”“I wanted to ask you something,” Dhani began nervously. “Can I come with you to Dandi?” Gandhiji smiled, “You are too small, beta. Dandi is  kilometres away and only young men like your father will be able to walk with me.” “But you are not young!” Dhani said. “Won’t you feel tired?” “I am a very good walker,” Gandhiji replied. “I am a good walker too.” Dhani was adamant. “Ah yes,” Gandhiji looked thoughtful. “But there is a problem. If you go with me, who will take care of Binni? After walking for so long, I will become weak. When I come back, I’ll need to drink lots of milk to become strong again.”“Hmm, you’re right, Gandhiji. Binni eats only when I feed her.” Dhani lovingly stroked Binni’s head, “And only I know what she likes to eat.” “Exactly! So will you stay in the ashram and take care of Binni for me?” ""Yes, Gandhiji, I will,” said Dhani. “And Binni and I will be waiting for you.”Fun facts of History .

“Dinner time!” called Daddy. Chikki and Ninu, who were playing outside, came running in. Daddy was already at the table. “What are we having?” asked Ninu. “Mooli parathas,” said Mummy. “And raita.” Chikki wrinkled her nose. “Yuck!” she said. Daddy frowned. “Never say that about food, Chikki.” “It smells,” said Chikki. “Chikki, Chikki, don’t be picky!” chanted Ninu, as he gobbled up a paratha. He loved all kinds of food but his sister was fussy. “Chikki, don’t you want to be an astronaut?” asked Mummy. “Yes,” agreed Chikki.Mummy was a scientist and Daddy had been a fighter pilot. Chikki wanted to study science. And then some day fly higher than Daddy! She wanted to be like the people who fly high into space and are called 'astronauts' or 'star sailors'. “Well,” said Mummy, “I have an idea. If you eat your parathas today, I'll make astronaut food for you tomorrow.” “Okay!” said Chikki happily and wolfed down her paratha.The next day, Chikki and Ninu came back from school for lunch. They were eager to see what Mummy had made. “I hope astronauts eat cake and ice cream,” said Ninu. “And pizza and panipuri,” piped Chikki. Instead, they saw a tube on their plates. “Toothpaste!” cried Ninu. “Is that what astronauts eat?” “Not toothpaste,” Mummy smiled. “I mashed up rice and dal and put it in the tube. You can squeeze it into your mouth.”“Why can’t we have rice and dal on the plate instead?” asked Chikki. Daddy had some on his plate. And it suddenly looked delicious. Daddy pointed to his food. “See how it stays on my plate? In space, it would float away.”Chikki and Ninu imagined bits of rice floating in the air. “Nomnomnom,” said Ninu as he pretended to catch the grains. “Watch out, rice, I’m coming for you!” “It looks like fun, but it would take very long to finish eating. And titbits could end up in the spaceship’s engines and make a mess,” said Daddy. “But why does food float in space?” asked Chikki. “It doesn't float down here!” “On Earth, we have a force called gravity. It keeps not just food but all of us from floating into space,” explained Daddy. “That is why when we throw a ball up into the air, it falls back down.”Mummy added, “Far, far away from Earth, there is almost no gravity. So, astronauts and other things in space weigh next to nothing. They float!” “And food out there has to be easy to eat and not float away every time someone tries to have lunch!” said Daddy. Chikki thought about that for a bit.“If gravity pulls everything closer to the ground then, don’t we also need it to make our food go from our mouths down to our stomachs? So how do astronauts eat? Won’t the food float back to their mouths when they try to swallow?”“Good question!” said Daddy. “When human beings started going into space, scientists wondered about that too. The first experiment they did was to have John Glenn, an astronaut, swallow some water.” “And could he?” asked Ninu. 'Imagine not being able to drink water! ' he thought. “Yes!” said Daddy. “It turns out that we can swallow because of the muscles in our food pipe–between the mouth and the stomach–and not because of gravity. That is why we can even eat upside down, though the muscles have to work harder against the gravity.”Chikki and Ninu looked at each other. This was an experiment they had to try! “Be careful,” warned Daddy, who knew what they were planning. “You should not eat or drink too much when you are upside down. Gravity is a pretty strong force.” Chikki looked at the tube on her plate. “So this is what astronauts eat?” She was disappointed. Mummy smiled. “When they first started going into space, astronauts ate meat and fruit pastes from tubes. This was not very tasty. So they complained, like you!” she said. “So scientists tried to come up with options that looked and tasted more like regular food. Today, astronauts get canned food, nuts, granola bars. . . anything they can eat in a single bite without leaving pesky crumbs. Space shuttles also have small kitchens with ovens where the food can be reheated. So Indian astronauts take fish and paneer curry, and other tasty dishes.”“What about pizza and ice cream and soda?” asked Ninu. “Scientists have been trying to send pizza to space for a long time. Making and baking dough in space is difficult, but a team of astronauts made pizza by using flatbread, sauce, and toppings. There are no freezers in space for ice cream,” said Daddy. “And the bubbles in soda behave in strange ways because of the lack of gravity,” said Mummy. “But astronauts eat lots of different foods,” said Daddy, “even fruit like apples and bananas. And scientists are trying to figure out a way to grow vegetables in space.” “And now,” said Mummy, with a twinkle in her eyes, “you have to try these gobi parathas.” “Oh no!” said Chikki. “But when I become an astronaut, I’m going to take panipuri along!”Did you know? • Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin’s first meal in space in  was beef and liver paste. Then he had chocolate sauce. • Astronauts in Russia are called cosmonauts, and Indian astronauts are called vyomanauts! • Astronauts live in space stations that orbit the earth. A space station is about the size of three houses and has a kitchen, bathroom, study and sleeping areas.• Salt and pepper are used in liquid form in space! • Astronauts attach containers to special trays using Velcro. They also fasten their trays to their laps, so they can eat while sitting down. • Astronauts drink from pouches with special nozzles. If they used cups, their coffee, tea or juice would become a ball and float around the cabin. • Since we don’t make a lot of saliva in space, food tastes bland. That is why astronauts love spicy food! • Astronauts choose what they eat. Food packages are labelled so they do not get mixed up.	./Story text files/528.txt	5760	15	5.777957860615883	508	109	135	44.72222222222222	76	50	26	9.079365079365079	66	60	337	280	4	1.410150891632373	652	77
"“Imma. . . Appa. . . come quick!” cried Langlen. Langlen’s parents found her crouching by the almirah watching three kittens playing with each other, mewling softly. “Imma. . .” started Langlen. “Shhh, softly,” said Imma. “Kittens are easily scared.”Suddenly, a big orange cat jumped in from the window. She ignored them and briskly went by and lay down. The three kittens rushed over and started suckling. Langlen and her parents tiptoed out.Langlen asked, “Wasn’t the grey one the MammaCat’s kitten as well?” “It was,” replied Appa. “They why wasn’t it orange? Like the MammaCat?” “Maybe the PappaCat is grey.” As Langlen was thinking about it, Appa continued, “The grey kitten has colouring like the PappaCat, just like Langlen has curly hair like Appa!”“But everyone says I look just like Imma. See, we even have clefts on our chins, which makes it look like our chins are divided.” “You have a bit of both of us, because you are our sweet Langlen,” said Imma hugging her tight. “Does the grey kitten also have a bit from both PappaCat and MammaCat?”“Yes. All creatures with two parents have traits from both parents,” explained Appa. “A trait? Oh wait, let me guess. Would my curly hair be called a trait?” “Yes, that’s a trait, Langlen. Any quality or characteristic you have is a trait. Can you think of others?” asked Imma. “Hmm. . . my height?” “Yes, that’s another. The colour of your eyes, shape of your ears, length of your fingers and toes, and shape of your nose are all some of your characteristics,” explained Imma. “My curly hair is a trait from Appa and cleft chin is a trait from Imma. Did you get those traits from your parents?” “YES! You catch on quick. And they got their traits from their parents,” said Imma.“But,” asked Langlen puzzled, “neither my grandmas nor my grandpas have cleft chins. Where did you get the trait from?” “Sometimes traits skip a generation or more. My grandfather, whom I called Pupu, had a cleft chin. His children, which included my mother, did not have that trait. Then I got it and passed it on to you.” “This makes me just a collection of traits from all of you,” said Langlen, a little sadly. Imma quickly hugged her. “No, Langlen. The passing of traits from parents to children is called heredity. We might share traits, but each one of us is different. Your combination of traits makes you unique!”“Look at me, Langlen,” said Appa. “I’m completely unique. Very tall, with long and curly hair on my head, face and ears. I am also the man with the widest feet in the world. What would you do if you had long curly hair on your ears? ""“Hmm. . . . I would plait it, Appa, and put colourful rubberbands!” Imma smiled at the two of them. “Women don’t have ear hair, Langlen, but you seem to have got your father’s trait for silly humour!”Appa went out of the room and Langlen snuggled into Imma’s lap. “I have one more question. *Ebok always says you had dimples like her. Where did they go?” Laughing, Imma said, “I did get my mother’s trait for dimples. But then, every trait has many influences. Some influences made it come and others made it disappear.” *Ebok: Grandmother in ManipuriAppa came back with a covered plate. “I am the influence which has made these yummy things magically appear on this plate!” So saying, he pulled the napkin off the plate. It was filled with hot vadas. “And we are the influences which will make them disappear?” said Langlen, stuffing her mouth without waiting for an answer.Understand the Difficult Words: Imma: Mother in Manipuri Ebok: Grandmother in Manipuri Pupu: Grandfather in Manipuri Cleft: Divided Traits: Characteristic in a person, e. g. , curly hair, cleft chin, dimples Heredity: Passing of traits from parents to children Generation: All the people that are born and live in about the same time Unique: One of a kind Influence: To have an effect on something Vadas: Fried savoury dishMake Your Own Family Tree As you may have already guessed, Langlen's mother is from Manipur and father from Tamil Nadu.

For the very first time, Maaloo is collecting vegetables from the garden. He has collected red tomatoes, fresh brinjals and green lady's fingers.Dadi says, “Well done, Maaloo! Go and get some potatoes too.”Maaloo looked at all the trees, creepers and plants. Not a single potato could he see.“Dadi, the potatoes aren’t ready yet,” said Maaloo, putting the empty basket down. “No Maaloo, there are plenty of potatoes. Look carefully,” said Dadi.Maaloo went into the garden once more. Kaaloo followed him. Maaloo was looking for potatoes when he heard, “Woof! Woof!”“Kaaloo! Stop, Kaaloo!” yelled Maaloo, running behind him. “Don’t spoil the garden.” Maaloo saw that Kaaloo was digging away and what do you think was coming out of the mud? Big fat potatoes!“Well done, Kaaloo. You found the potatoes!” laughed Maaloo, filling his basket with potatoes.	./Story text files/229.txt	849	14	6.433333333333334	68	22	89	35.95652173913044	16	7	19	6.826086956521739	17	6	56	34	4	1.5794392523364487	93	14
"There is a new girl at Mira's busstop today. Everyone stares at her. No one talks to her. On the school bus, everybody sits with their friends. The new girl sits alone.At school, Salma Miss has a surprise for Mira and her classmates. ""We have a new friend in our classroom! "" It is the new girl! Everyone stares at the new girl. ""She looks different! "" they say. Salma Miss says they must be kind and helpful to Zenie – that’s the name of the new girl.Mira remembers being the new girl once. Nobody spoke to her. Nobody played with her. She smiles at Zenie. Zenie smiles back. During art period, Mira shares her crayons with Zenie. At recess, they share their lunch. They sit together on the busride home and even play in the evening. They are BEST FRIENDS!Some children make fun of Zenie. They call her names that mean 'foreigner'. ""She is INDIAN! "" Mira tells them angrily. But they simply laugh. Zenie is upset. ""It’s okay to be different! "" Mira tells her. Mira has often heard her mother say that to her brother who gets teased about his glasses.One day, Salma Miss gives them a new project. Everyone is excited. Everyone, except Zenie. ""What should I do, Mira? "" she asks. ""Don't worry, Zenie! You can talk about your family, festivals, or your home. "" Mira tells her. ""But they will laugh at me, Mira! "" she says. ""When you speak, just look at the people who are nice to you, "" Mira tells her, remembering her mother’s words.When the big day arrives, there is plenty of excitement in the classroom. Salma Miss takes pictures of them in their costumes. Zenie is not to be seen. She was not at the busstop either. Mira hopes she is not skipping school on this special day. Soon it is time to begin.Parth is wearing a traditional angarakhochorno from Gujarat. His twin sister, Puja is wearing a chaniyacholi. Together, they perform the garba. Veena sings a beautiful freedom song in Tamil, her mother tongue.Other children talk about festivals and traditions, food and famous people of India. When it is Mira's turn, she proudly presents a slideshow about the princely state of Rajasthan, where she was born. Then, someone with tall headgear walks in.It is… Zenie! They can hardly recognize her with her costume and makeup! Mira can tell that she is nervous. ""I come from Mizoram, one of India’s twentynine states, "" Zenie begins. Everyone listens intently. They’ve never heard her speak much. ""My dress is called a puanchei. Now I will show you a Mizo dance called Chheihlam. ""Salma Miss turns on the music. Zenie begins to move gracefully, enjoying herself. Some children giggle, but she ignores them. She is enjoying herself so much that nothing can stop her. Soon Salma Miss joins Zenie. A few children dance along too. Others, like Mira, clap to the rhythm of the music. Everyone is having fun!When the music stops, so does Zenie. There is a sudden silence in the classroom. Salma Miss applauds. The entire class joins in. On the busride home, Zenie is very happy. ""You were right, Mira! It is okay to be different. "" No one teases Zenie anymore. She is now ‘one of them’!"	./Story text files/236.txt	3081	15	5.7253731343283585	266	69	115	37.525	59	21	22	7.85	55	25	202	133	6	1.3670886075949367	351	44
"""Happy Birthday, Vishakha! "" ""This party is awesome, aunty.” said Rohit. Vishakha was happy because many of her friends had come for her birthday party.Vishakha's mother hugged Rohit in response. That is what everybody loved about her. She was affectionate and she loved all the kids like her own. The parents and their kids loved her back. They were always there in her time of need. And so was she.""This is the best birthday ever! "" exclaimed Vishakha excitedly as all her friends settled down to watch a movie. The movie was about a tiger and his cub that were playing and having fun in the jungle. This movie made Vishakha a bit sad. Why? She didn't know.All of Vishakha's friends left soon after the movie, Rohit was the last one to go. ""That was a really nice movie, wasn't it Vish? "" asked Rohit. ""Oh! I loved it. "" said Vishakha happily. ""But where is your father? I have never seen him. "" Questioned Rohit.""Father? Daddy? Dad? Yeah, where is my father? Maa, where is he? "" Her mother yawned and said ""time for bed, come on kiddo. "" ""But, but. . . but I want a father too, just like that cub! """"Come on now Vishakha, mommy is tired. Come here and give mommy a goodnight kiss. "" ""But MAAAAAA! ! ! "" ""VISHAKHA! "" shouted her mother. ""Okay Maa. "" said Vishakha sadly.The next day school was off. Hence, Vishakha and Rohit sat down and read together. ""Where should I look for him, Rohit? Where do you usually look when your father is missing? "" ""The washroom, that's his favourite hiding spot. That's where I look for my dad. "" ""I checked but he wasn’t there. Do you know where my father is? "" ""Umm, I don't know. But this book says that parrots speak and they knowitall. "" ""But, I don't have a parrot. "" ""Oh! I do. Let's go! """"Mirchi, look who is here. "" called out Rohit to his parrot. ""KiKiVishakha"" chirped the parrot. ""O, Mirchi! Dear Mirchi. Do you know who my father is? Or where is he"" ""NO! ! ! Is he cute like I am? "" ""That's what I am asking you. "" ""KiKikaka"" ""Rohit, what does he mean? """"Hello, Vishakha. How are you darling? "" said Rohit's mother. ""Aunty, aunty do you know where my father is? I was just asking Mirchi about it, but he won't say. "" ""Haha! Mirchi is a nutcase. You should ask your mother, she will know. "" ""I tried auntyyyy! But Maa has no idea either. "" ""Hmm. It is getting late. You should go home. "" ""Yes I should. Bye aunty. ""That evening Vishakha wasn't able to stop thinking about her father. What he looked like, what was his profession and most of all where was he, questions like these kept propping up in her mind. She decided she will talk to her mother. Her mother looked quite different, she couldn't understand why! ""Hey Maa! Are you alright? "" asked Vishakha softly.""Come here Vish, look at these stars! Look how they shine. "" ""They are adorable Maa. I wish I was a star. "" ""One day, you will be. Just like your father. "" ""My father is a star? "" asked Vishakha excitedly. ""Yes darling, he is. Can you see that star? The one which is the brightest! "" ""Aah haan. "" ""Well, that is your father, smiling at you. "" ""Hello Papa! Maa, can he hear me? "" ""A little louder will do, Vish. ""She smiled at the star, closed her eyes, tried counting the distance and then yelled at the top of her voice, ""Come home, Papa.

The year was . New London, Connecticut, United States.  am. Kids were tumbling out of bed, their mothers hurrying them to clean their teeth, handing them tooth sticks and jars of toothpaste.What? Did I just say – “Toothsticks” ? That’s right. They used toothsticks to clean their teeth back in . A toothstick was simply a twig with a frayed end. Some lucky kids had twigs with boar hair tied to one end for that extra shine.And what was that other thing I said? “Jars of toothpaste” ? That’s right. Toothpaste tubes were not invented yet. They only had jars. And every bleary eyed kid started her day by dipping a toothstick into a porcelain jar filled with toothpaste.Actually, into the same porcelain jar that every other member of the family dipped their toothstick into. Including that visiting grand aunt with yellow and black teeth, whose toothstick matched her teeth.One morning, a disgusted cry went up in a dentist’s house. “Ewwwwwwwwww!” It was Dr. Sheffield’s son Lucius, who refused to dip into the jar anymore and decided to use tooth powder henceforth. But a thought remained in his mind – there must be a better way to use toothpaste.A few years later, Lucius went to Paris to study the science of dentistry. There, he saw artists squeezing paint from metal tubes on to their paintbrushes. Why couldn't the same type of tube be used to hold toothpaste? ! He rushed back home and shared this idea with his father, who thought that it was just totally awesome.There was just that little matter of figuring out how to get the toothpaste from a jar into the tube through that little opening. How do you think Lucius could fill toothpaste into an empty tube? Have you had a bad morning when you squeezed way too much paste in your half asleep state? And you see that there’s toothpaste all over the sink and your mother is reminding you that the school bus will be at the doorstep in twenty minutes, and the last thing you want is for her to flip when she sees the mess you’ve made? How would you go about putting the toothpaste back into the tube? Now, what do you think Lucius and his father used to fill a tube with toothpaste? A ear bud? Or a really tiny spoon? A toothpick?It was not as messy as you’d expect, because the way Dr. Sheffield and his team did it was without opening the cap! That’s right, they kept the cap screwed on tight, and opened up the other end! It’s definitely easier to fill a tube from the larger end, especially if you have something to pump the paste with, like a syringe. After that, all you have to do is seal the end tight so that the paste will not leak.Today, toothpaste tubes are filled using machines. All the empty tubes are lined up on a conveyer belt with their caps downwards and the unsealed end pointing up. A big container filled with toothpaste is fixed above the conveyor belt.From a nozzle at the bottom of the container, the toothpaste is let into each of these tubes as they move along the conveyor belt. But the paste is not filled all the way to the brim. About half an inch is left so that it can be sealed. Now the tube is ready to be squeezed!Ancient Indian wisdom for good teeth Many people in India use datun, the twig of a neem or babool tree, instead of a factorymade brush. Datun keeps teeth and gums healthy. But do you know which the best brush in the world is? Your fingers, say dentists! Great for the teeth and gums. Have you tried tooth powder? What are the different smells that you can detect in it? Herbs and spices that are good for teeth include mint, clove, cinnamon, black pepper and tulsi. Eating fibrous fruits and vegetables, like apples and carrots, is good for cleaning teeth.Fun with toothpaste caps	./Story text files/130.txt	3689	20	5.871508379888268	282	76	232	61.54237288135593	25	34	47	12.35593220338983	23	36	200	158	5	1.396551724137931	367	39
Sister, sister, I wonder… What do you wonder, little brother, What do you wonder? I wonder, I wonder, why things don’t fall up. What do you think, little brother, What do you think? I think, I think… Tell me, little brother, what do you think?I think That long ago, things did fall up That the sky was full of toffee wrappers And ice cream sticks That stars slipped on banana peels That sometimes, the moon cut her dainty feet On bits of broken glass Or caught her trailing silver skirts On a rusty nail.I think The old woman who lives in the sky Got so tired of cleaning the mess That she put a curse on the earth; And things have fallen down ever since. I think that’s why things don’t fall up Because the old woman in the sky Was fed up of living in a smelly pigsty. I’m clever, aren’t I, sister?Oh yes, you are, little brother, And maybe you’re right, too… But in the books that I have read That is not what they said. Then what did they say, sister, What did they say? What do you think, little brother, What do you think? I think, I think… Tell me, little brother, what do you think?I think That long ago, things did fall up And drove Mother mad. Father's keys, The screw of her nosestud, The coins you were tossing from hand to hand (even though you knew Mother would scold if she knew) On your way back from the market; All fell up and disappeared.Mother prayed to all her Gods. One of them took pity on her, And things fell down and vanished no more. Mother was happy (for a while) Now she complains about the mess on the floor. I think that’s why things don’t fall up All thanks to a woman’s pleas For fewer lost coins, and screws, and keys. I’m clever, aren’t I, sister?I know you are, little brother, And maybe you’re right, too… But in the books that I have read That is not what they said. Then what did they say, sister, What did they say? What do you think, little brother, What do you think? I think, I think… Tell me, little brother, what do you think?I think There is a big greedy demon inside the earth All day he waits, his mouth a gaping hole Sucking in mighty lungfuls of air… And nothing can fall up As long as he keeps sucking in — Everything heads towards that greedy hole.I think Many things go right in. My marbles, your hairclips, The yummy laddoos Mother makes Which I don’t eat and you don’t eat But which disappear somehow. I think that is why things don’t fall up Because they hurtle earthwards to feed An underground demon’s greed. I’m clever, aren’t I, sister?Of course you are, little brother, Of course you are And maybe you’re right, too… But in all the books that I have read That is not what they said. Then what did they say, sister, What did they say?Come here, little brother, I’ll tell you what they said. They said, they said… Tell me what they said, sister, Tell me what they said.They said That everything, just everything In the great big universe Pulls everything, just everything else In the great big universe Towards itself.They said That BIG things can pull much harder At small things Than small things can pull At BIG things. But why don’t things fall up, sister, Why don’t things fall up? Be patient, little brother, be patient now.They said The earth, our home, Is a very BIG thing And all of us, and everything else on earth— Our aeroplanes, our blue whales, even our oceans— Are very small things.And that's why The earth pulls us towards itself MUCH, MUCH harder Than we can pull the earth Towards us. SO HARD That we, or our keys, or our screws, or our coins, Cannot escape, float away, disappear, Or fall up.This GREAT force, this GIGANTIC force With which the earth pulls us All of us, Even the penguins at the edge of the earth, Towards itself Is called GRAVITY. Can it be true, sister, can it be true? I can’t say, little brother, I can’t say. But in all the books that I have read That is what they said.FIND OUT MORE! Why don’t things fall up? About  years ago, a famous English scientist called Isaac Newton was relaxing under an apple tree when an apple fell and hit him SMACK! on the head. Rubbing his sore head, Newton wondered why things never fell up. Finally, he came up with the theory that the earth was like a giant magnet, which attracted everything around it with great force. He called this invisible force ‘gravity’. He also concluded that everything in the universe attracts everything else. Bigger objects attract each other with greater force than smaller ones. Also, as the distance between two objects increases, the force of attraction between them decreases.Gravity, however, does not just make apples fall down from trees. It also keeps the moon in orbit around the earth and all the planets in orbit around the sun. The force of the earth’s gravity keeps the moon from flying away into space. But why doesn’t the moon fall towards the earth? Because the moon has its own gravity, with which it attracts the earth. It is because the earth’s gravity is greater, that the moon goes around the earth. If the moon’s was greater, the earth would have gone around the moon instead!Try this experiment! You need: A few rubber bands A small rubber ball A length of string What to do: Put the rubber bands around the ball in such a way that they grip it tightly. Tie the string to one of the rubber bands around the ball. Stand somewhere where there is plenty of room and swing the ball around your head. If you swing it hard enough, the ball will go around your head in a horizontal circle. Now let go of the string. What happens? The ball flies away in a straight line.Why does this happen? Because there is a tension force in the string, which keeps the ball turning around your head. When you let go of the string, the tension force disappears and the ball goes flying. Now imagine the ball is the moon and you are the earth. The earth's gravity is like the tension force in the string! If this tension force did not exist, the moon would fly away into space!	./Story text files/139.txt	5943	18	5.622073578595318	515	83	260	78.25333333333333	20	55	50	15.653333333333334	15	60	383	215	4	1.3415384615384616	604	46

Mukhil has been in bed all day. She has a fever. She’s really tired but her head is buzzing with questions. Will Amma let her miss tomorrow’s maths test? Will she be too tired for playtime with friends? And when did her room get so cold?Amma comes in with a bowl of rice kanji. COUGH! COUGH! COUGH! Amma looks worried and takes her temperature. “ degrees! Oh no!” Mukhil’s body is so warm, but she feels so cold. “Maybe we should take a blood test,” says Amma.Mukhil sits up in alarm. A blood test? “But I have not studied for any tests!” “It’s not that kind of test,” Amma laughs. “The doctor will take a little of your blood to look at it under the microscope.”“But what if all my blood drips out and I end up empty?” Mukhil asks. She is terrified. “Don’t worry,” says Amma. “An adult has at least five litres of blood in their body. You’re a child and even you will have at least three litres! That’s almost  teaspoons of blood. The doctor will just need a few drops.”As Mukhil dozes off that afternoon, she sees a ghost in a long white coat getting ready to suck her blood. What long teeth it has! Mukhil wakes up cold and shivering. Phew! It's only a dream!In the evening, Amma and Mukhil go to a clinic. Mukhil sees a nurse coming towards her with a long rubber cord. “Is he going to tie me up?” she yells.The doctor laughs, “No, no. This is a tourniquet. Here, sit down and curl the fingers of your left hand into a fist.” The nurse ties the tourniquet around Mukhil’s left arm tightly. “The cord is just to help him draw the blood easily,” she says.Then the nurse brings out a syringe saying, “This will only take a few seconds.” Mukhil jumps out of the chair when she sees the needle. “Oh Mukhil! You will need to be brave,” says Amma. So Mukhil climbs back in and shuts her eyes.The needle goes in. Ouch! Mukhil opens one eye to see the syringe filling up with blood. It is dark red, almost maroon. The nurse slowly pulls out the needle and presses a small piece of cotton to soak up a drop of blood. “Bend your arm at the elbow and hold it like that for a few minutes,” he says.“Is that all?” Mukhil asks the doctor, thinking that it wasn’t so bad. The blood is now in a small plastic tube. “That’s it! You can collect the results tomorrow,” replies the doctor, “The lab will check your blood to see if everything is alright.”On the way home, Amma buys some candied cherries for Mukhil. They are as maroon as her blood. Mukhil eats them all up.The next day, Amma brings home the blood test results. “Have I passed?” Mukhil asks in a worried tone. “Yes,” says Amma, “The doctor says it’s just a flu. You’ll be fine soon!”Mukhil smiles. She is feeling better already. And she can't WAIT to tell her friends at school about how she passed her first blood test!Colourful Blood Human beings and many other animals have RED blood. But some animals have blood of other colours. Did you know that some beetles and the sea cucumber have YELLOW blood? Some worms that live in the sea have GREEN blood and some worms have PURPLE blood.

A breeze lifted the leaf In the air, from where it lay!Just then the skies opened A few raindrops fell The little leaf shook It was scared one could tell A little boy came And picked up the leaf Dusted it off And wiped the mud clean!How pretty this is He thought to himself And pasted it in the book Kept on the shelf!	./Story text files/356.txt	452	9	5.1875	42	6	177	74.5	2	4	36	16.0	1	5	36	12	3	1.2549019607843137	50	1

March  It’s so hot here! Golu was very naughty today. She climbed up a slant and would not come down. Silly goat! Seema and Gullu had to help me get her down.March  I can see the snowcapped Himalayan peaks–Nandakot, Maiktoli, Panchachuli, Chaukhamba. But Kumaon is dry. Gullu and I help Ija and Baujyu* get water from the pump down the road, or from the stream further down. Ooof! Wish the water could reach us directly from the snowy mountains. Drinking water is difficult to get even in January, when it snows. *Ija and Baujyu: Kumaoni words for ‘mother’ and ‘father’.April  Our tenday summer workshop with Reena didi started today. She has come from Mumbai. She asked us thousands of questions! What do you like about school? What do you not like about school? How do you commute to school? Suddenly she turned to me and asked the meaning of my name. “Himani means snow,” I said.Why does she ask so many questions?April  What a fun day it was! We played a game. One of us needed to think of a problem that we might have faced and state it in the form of a question. Then another classmate had to ask a question related to it. It was almost like a chain story. We had so many questions!How can we get clean drinking water in school? Why can’t we have a pipe straight from the melting glaciers? Why do we need clean water? Where will the water come from? Why do you ask such questions?Why don’t we concentrate on our water problem? Why can’t we have a water filter? Where will we get a water filter from? Why can’t we make it? Who knows how to make one?April  We were surfing the Internet when I found this chart: SOLVE ANY PROBLEM, STEP BY STEP > Identify the problem. > Find out everything you can about the problem. > Discuss. > Decide on the most suitable idea. > Try it out. > If you succeed, very good! > If not, try another idea.Could we really solve a problem using this method?April  At school, we made a list of our problems. How many problems do we have?BIG PROBLEMS No direct water at home or school Landslides Slippery roads to school during the monsoon Leeches in our socks during the rains. No hospital or clinic near by Neighbours who get violent after drinkingPROBLEMS WE CAN SOLVE Heavy school bag Unclean drinking water Unlit paths at night Plastic bottles everywhereApril  Worked with Ija and Baujyu in the cauliflower patch. Then ran to school for problemsolving day! We went out in pairs to the library, and to talk to our teachers and to each other. Then we came back to class. . Identify: The problem is unfiltered drinking water at school. Students keep falling sick because of this. . Find out: Why is getting clean water a problem here? Many streams around Kumaon are supposed to have pure water. There are no streams near our school. . Discuss: We found out that some people use cloth. This only filters bigger sediments, not harmful bacteria. Manorama said they have a small water filter at home. Moringa seeds in water pots help purify water, said a teacher. . Decide: Would a water purifier help us?Try it out! Pebbles Moringa Seeds Coarse Sand Charcoal Fine Sand Cloth We all drew water filters! We decided we needed one that could be attached to the nozzle of our water drum. Santosh bhai and Ashish bhai, our seniors, helped us make a water filter based on our drawings. They have taken a few days off from college to make a water catchment system in our school. The filtered water tasted so fresh and clean!April  In the last three days, we’ve done a lot of art. We have applied the problemsolving method to come up with more ideas.Cycle Plough Does not require cattle or a tractor to pull it. Good for narrow step farms. Bottle Torch Torch made with recycled parts. Fitted inside a discarded plastic bottle, so that dampness does not spoil it. Dampness spoils battery operated torches very quickly in this region. Miniirrigator Drip irrigation for crops like grapes that need soil to stay hydrated. Made with recycled water bottles, attached to plants like IV tubes in hospitals.April  Now that the workshop is over, we’re all busy with harvesting and packing apricots, pears, apples and rhododendron flowers. Ija and Baujyu are so nimble and good at picking fruits! Not me. Yesterday, I slipped and twisted my ankle while picking fruit. No fracture, thank God! I wish I had a gadget that could pick fruits for me! Maybe we could train Golu and the other goats to pick fruits, ha, ha.Seriously, how wonderful it would be to have an efficient, safe, eco friendly applepicking machine!	./Story text files/90.txt	4520	16	5.953191489361702	367	103	239	49.233333333333334	53	37	39	10.022222222222222	44	46	236	234	6	1.4413919413919414	485	61
One day, Sringeri Srinivas, the farmer, set out with his best cows to the cattle fair. He had to walk along the new national highway that had come up near his village.That big road had many cars and trucks. Every driver seemed to be honking loudly. Paoon! Ponn! Paaa! The cows did not like the noise. They decided to go back home.He waved his hands at the drivers to stop the noise. This did not help. Seeing him, they just honked louder. The noise of the horns went straight into his head. And it stayed there. It was a bad day for him. He went back home with his cows. MOOO! The cows were happy to be in the cowshed again.But the noise simply would not go away from his head. Paoon! Ponn! Paaa! It kept on playing like a band of untrained musicians. Other noises around him soon joined in the chorus. Even the sounds that he heard daily suddenly became too loud for Sringeri Srinivas.The ribbit ribbit of the frogs was noisy. The cicadas and their kirkk kirkk were too loud. Sringeri Srinivas wanted the hooting owls to be sent away. He was angry at the koyals for screeching loudly at  am.And at the cows that mooed at  am. And whoever asked the roosters to act as alarm clocks? And that stupid tiger! Enough of his roaring!Poor Sringeri Srinivas. His ears had become raw, like a fresh wound. He tried hard to keep things quiet. He shouted at the children if they talked loudly. He glared at his wife Parvatamma when the pressure cooker whistled and whistled.Sringeri Srinivas only wanted silence. Everyone tried to help. Parvatamma stopped scolding the children. The children played cricket quietly with a very soft ball.The cows did not moo any more. The cicadas and owls moved to another village. Even the tiger stopped growling.Yet Sringeri Srinivas was not happy. He could hear the noise of everyone trying to be silent!“I will go away from this place,” he declared one morning. “Please don’t,” said Parvatamma. “Where will you find silence?” Sringeri Srinivas simply frowned at her and started to walk away from his village.Soon, he came close to a new town. He watched the noisy people in the noisy town. A young man passed by. He had some wires dangling from his ears. Sringeri Srinivas could also hear a ‘ting dang ting dang’ sound. The man looked very happy. He did not even notice that trucks were blaring horns nearby.“What is this?” he asked the man. “These are my headphones. Here, try them on,” the young man said. He put them on for Sringeri Srinivas. Music! Ting dang ting dang. No horns. “Aha! This is just what I need,” he said.Sringeri Srinivas went into the town. He bought a pair of the best headphones and put them on. At last. . . no more noise! He returned to his village, with his big new headphones.His wife was happy to see him. Sringeri Srinivas gave her a big smile. His children helped him to connect the new headphones to some good, happy music.Now, when Sringeri Srinivas gets very angry at the cars or even at the frogs, he puts on his headphones and listens to the silence. Or he listens to good music. In the village, the cows are mooing again. The koyals have come back. Ribbit ribbit, go the frogs. Kirkk kirkk, sing the cicadas.But the cars on the highway are still making too much noise. Paoon! Ponn! Paaa! It is not a good sound. Sringeri Srinivas has to take his cows to the fair soon. Will they want headphones too?	./Story text files/262.txt	3361	17	5.810198300283286	282	71	130	35.54347826086956	68	24	25	7.608695652173913	57	35	203	150	4	1.3215962441314555	375	51

Khajuria village was suffering from Ramlila fever. It was nothing new, as Kallu said, they got it every year. The fever usually started a month before Dussehra. As the low, dark grey monsoon clouds drifted away and the sky turned a glittering blue, there were festivities in the air and everyone began talking about Masterji and the Ramlila. Everywhere in the village, at Dharampal’s chai shop, in the vegetable fields, at the grocery store, in Moti Dadi’s courtyard and at the tubewell, there was a single question being asked. “What is Masterji planning to do this year?” Kallu often said admiringly, “Masterji is the producer, director, scriptwriter and music composer of Ramlila and only he knows what we will see this year.”Masterji was the head of the village school and the Khajuria Ramlila Party that put up a fantastic show every year. Of course, they couldn’t do the whole Ramayana because that was a very long story, and Khajuria did not have enough actors. So Masterji had written the dialogues of some of the most important scenes, and he would pick a few of them to enact for a week before Dussehra. So Khajuria never knew which scenes they would see. A tent was put up in a corner of the field where Badri, the milkman kept his buffaloes. A stage was built with a bunch of wobbly folding tables they got from Jai Bhagwan’s Tent House. The audience sat on the ground on durries and nowadays, as the village had electricity, they had both gas lamps and electric bulbs to light up the stage.From the first day, Kallu and his gang were hanging around the school building where rehearsals were held, hoping Masterji would give them something to do. In the gang were Kallu, his sister Munia, brother Shabbo and his best friend Damu and his sister Saru. Day after day, they sat and watched the rehearsals, and by the end they knew most of the dialogues by heart. Every year, Masterji would select scenes like the Sita swayamvar with Ram breaking the giant bow; then Kaikeyi and Manthara scheming to send Ram into exile and Dasaratha weeping and dying. Munia’s favourite scene was of Laxman cutting off Surpanakha’s nose and Ravan kidnapping Sita. Then there was Hanuman setting fire to Lanka, and finally the fantastic battle scenes with Ravan, Kumbhakarna and Meghnad fighting Ram, Laxman, Hanuman and their monkey army.This year, their begging had paid off and Masterji had let Kallu, Damu and Shabbo play monkeys in the vanar sena. They were acting in the final battle scene and had to wear shorts, have monkey face makeup and long tails. It was amazing fun as they jumped about waving tin maces and swords. It made the girls, Munia and Saru very envious. “It’s sooo silly!” Saru said grimly as they headed for the school one morning. “Why can’t girls act in the Ramlila?” “Did you see ‘Sita’ last night?” Munia asked. “That boy studies in Kallu Bhaiya’s class and he’s starting to get a moustache…” “And his voice kept cracking,” Saru giggled. “I really think Billo Chachi would be just perfect as Sita.”“Yes she would! Now if her husband Dharam Chacha can play Ram, why can’t she be Sita?” “She even asked Masterji, but he said that the Khajuria panchayat would stop the Ramlila if he took real women. Dhat!” Saru shook her head in disgust. “Anyway, tonight’s Badri Bhaiya’s big scene!” Munia gave a small skip of happiness. “I can’t wait!” For Kallu and his gang, the best actor in the show was Badri, the mad buffalo man who always played Hanuman. He was short and stocky, had a head of unruly hair, a bushy moustache, big round eyes and a booming voice. So when he was on stage, strutting about yelling out his lines, even Ram and Laxman faded into the background.According to Kallu and his gang, the scene where Hanuman exchanges insults with Ravan and then sets Lanka on fire was an absolute superhit scene. Masterji had written such fantastic dialogues for Ravan and Hanuman that the audience was totally hypnotized and listened to every word in breathless silence. That evening, the gang was among the earliest to arrive at the tent. Badri’s buffaloes were tied nearby and according to Damu, they had to do ‘high jumps’ over the pats of buffalo dung. “Second row from the front, middle of the row. Perfect!” said Shabbo, settling down on the durrie with a happy sigh.“Well, tomorrow we won’t need the seats,” said Kallu, giving Munia and Saru a sneaky grin. “We boys will be on stage.” “Hah!” Munia shook her curly head. “All you do is jump around like idiots, and none of you have a single line to say.” “And Shabbo will be killed by Meghnad and just lie there flat on his back, like a log of wood,” added Saru with a giggle. “Do you know it takes real acting to play dead?” Shabbo asked hotly. “I have to breathe very, very slowly and keep my eyes shut tight!” “You’ll get the award for the best dead monkey in Khajuria!” Damu grinned. As the sun set, the tent began to fill up.Backstage was a hive of activity, with everyone putting on their costumes and slapping on makeup. Dharampal was free tonight, as Ram did not appear in the scene, so he was busy doing the Hanuman makeup on Badri’s face. “I wish you would shave off your moustache Badri,” he said. “It looks really odd. Hanuman on TV and films is always cleanshaven.” “Colour it brown and no one will know,” growled Badri. “I am NOT shaving it! FORGET IT! !” Then he held the sheets of dialogue before his face, squinted and grumbled, “Why does Masterji keep changing the dialogues every year?”“He’s an artist and all artists are crazy anyway. This year in the Bharat milap scene, he wanted Ram and Bharat to sing a song,” said Dharampal. “A song?” repeated Badri. “Yes. It went  bhai bhai ka pyar amar rahe… something… something…” Dharampal laughed. “But you can’t sing!” said Badri. “Exactly! And neither can Lattu, who’s playing Bharat! He tried for two days to make us sing and then gave up. Thank God!” said Dharampal. Suddenly, Badri sat up and yelled at the top of his voice, making Dharampal jump, “Masterji! Masterji!” “Kya hua?” Masterji came running in a panic.“You wrote a song for Ram but not for Hanuman? And I can sing!” said Badri. “Arrey Badri!” Masterji stuffed a paan into his mouth, “Hanuman does not sing.” “And what will you sing anyway?” asked Dharampal carefully painting Badri’s nose a bright red. “HanumanRavan ki dushmani amar rahe?” “Heh… heh… ho… ho…” Masterji walked away laughing, spraying paan juice in the air. As Dharampal began to attach the tail to Badri’s bright yellow shorts, nobody noticed the thoughtful look on BadriHanuman’s brown face…An hour later, the curtains were dragged away to reveal Ravan's royal durbar in Lanka, and it looked really gorgeous with carpets, curtains and thrones, all supplied by Jai Bhagwan's tent house. Jai Bhagwan was playing Kumbhakarna because he was the fattest man in the village. The scene was going beautifully and the audience was absorbed in the action. Ravan was being played by Chhotey Lal, the village wrestler and Mandodari by Narain, who was in class ten, wearing a pink and gold sari. Ravan looked really threatening with his rippling muscles, bushy eyebrows, curling moustache and big eyes. The only problem was that Chhotey wasn’t very good at remembering the dialogues.“Masterji really struggled to make Chhotey remember his lines,” Damu whispered. “He mixes up everything.” “And then Masterji solved the problem!” Kallu grinned. The others turned to look at him, “How?” “Watch Narain’s lips, he’s prompting Chhotey. Masterji made him learn the lines of both Mandodari and Ravan!” whispered Kallu. “Sooo clever!” breathed Munia in admiration. “Here he comes!” said Saru with an excited wriggle as Hanuman was dragged on to the stage by the rakshasas. They leaned forward, eyes glued to Hanuman, who was all tied up in thick ropes but stood defiantly tall, glaring angrily at Ravan.“Who is this?” Mandodari whispered to Chhotey, prompting away. “Umm…” Ravan bent his head towards her, listened and then said loudly, “Who is this?” A rakshasa stepped forward, “We caught him in the Ashokavan, Maharaj! He was talking to Devi Sita.” “What…” prompted Mandodari. “WHAT!” shouted Ravan springing up, suddenly remembering the rest of his lines, “How did he get inside? What was he doing there?” and he waved his arms in rage. Munia gave a soft giggle, and then as other people spotted Ravan’s face, the rest of the audience also began to laugh. As he was waving his arms, Ravan had dislodged one end of his false moustache, and now it was dangling over his lips like a black earthworm.From where he sat, Kallu could see Masterji in the wings frantically waving his arms and pointing to Ravan’s face. About to start his lines, Hanuman turned to look at the audience in surprise. This was a serious scene. What was making them laugh? “Kya hua?” he asked, peering into the dark. “Why are you laughing?” “Ravan’s moustache is falling off, Badri Bhaiya!” someone kindly informed him from the back. “Oh ho! Sorry!” Ravan jumped nervously and quickly fixed the moustache back in place, and then turned a sweaty face towards Mandodari, “What do I say next?” In his panic he forgot to whisper, and everyone began to laugh again.In the wings, Masterji was chewing his paan faster and faster… “Tell me who you are… you thieving monkey!” Mandodari prompted. “What?” Ravan was still a bit flustered. “Theek! Tell me who you are… you thieving monkey!” And he finally turned to address Hanuman, “Where have you come from?” “Here it comes!” Shabbo leaned forward eagerly, “My favourite dialogue.” Masterji had written some of the important dialogues in rhyme, and the bit where Hanuman introduces himself to Ravan was the best poetry Shabbo had ever heard. And Badri’s acting was always quite superb!He would stand tall, thump his chest and ask angrily, “Thieving monkey? Who are you to call me that? Do you know who I am?” and then turning to face the audience, he would launch into the poem that Shabbo knew by heart… Main hooon Ramji ka chela Main hoon Hanuman albela Tu hai Ravan balwaan Kar du tujhko pareshan Then he would pause dramatically, thump his chest again and say in ringing tones… Main hoon pavan putra Hanumaaan! As they waited breathlessly, Hanuman glared at Ravan and shouted, “Do you know who I am?” He turned to face the audience, cleared his throat and suddenly Badri began to sing!Main hoooon Ramjiii kaaa chelaaa… “He’s SINGING?” Saru’s eyes were wide with shock. Main hoon… Hanumaaan… albelaaa… Hanuman sang on… “He’s good!” Kallu was laughing in delight. “Badri Bhaiya can really sing.” In the wings, Masterji was standing absolutely still, as if struck by lightning. He was staring at his star actor as Badri sang away, and in shock he had forgotten to chew his paan. Badri sang, eyes raised to the roof and one arm raised like a filmi hero. His tune had a nice rhythm, and the audience began to clap, and even Narain forgot he was on stage and joined in.One rakshasa was swaying his hips in a really funny dance. Badri began to smile, and with a happy shake of his head, he decided to sing the whole song once again! As he got to the last line, he waved to the crowd to join in and then sang out, Main hoon pavan putra… And the audience joined in a loud shout, Hanumaaaan! From the field outside, Badri’s loyal buffaloes joined in the chorus, “Mooo! Moooooo!” As they headed for home tiredly, Kallu declared with a huge, happy sigh, “What a superhit Ramlila!”	./Story text files/325.txt	11434	20	6.011570247933884	935	275	329	64.7183908045977	86	88	55	12.419540229885058	77	97	529	681	5	1.599706744868035	1159	205
"Mani put his Schoolbag down on the Coffee Table and groaned. His shoulders hurt, but his head hurt even more. It had been a long day. The Amulet around his neck flashed once. “Manikantan, put your Schoolbag where it belongs,” said the Coffee Table. “Yes Manikantan,” agreed the Schoolbag, “I don’t belong here. I suggest you put me in your Room in a proper place.”Mani knew better than to argue. He picked up the Schoolbag and trudged towards his Room. He put away his Schoolbag on the Desk, kicked off his Shoes, and then lay down on the Bed. He groaned. “Are you not feeling well, Manikantan?” asked the Room. “I’m fine. Leave me alone.” Mani moved the Amulet to the back of his neck. He longed to throw it into the Trash. The objects in the House would still be able to spy on him but at least they wouldn’t be able to talk to him. “You groaned twice.” The Room’s voice sounded muffled. “Do you have a headache, Manikantan?” “Leave me alone.” Then after a pause, Mani added, “Yes.” “Tsk, tsk. So sorry to hear that, Manikantan.” The Room sounded very sympathetic. “I have let your Amma know. Perhaps you are hungry. That may be why you’re having a headache. How about a nice hot cup of chai and some pakodas? ""Chai and pakodas would be nice, though Mani wished the Room hadn’t told amma he had a headache. Now she would worry. “Okay.” “Great. I have told the Kitchen. And Manikantan, put your Shoes in the ShoeRack.” “Yes,” said the ShoeRack, “I have plenty of space. Waiting.” Mani knew he should get up, but he didn’t feel like it. Maybe he should just sleep a little. He was so tired. “Waiting,” said the ShoeRack. Mani closed his eyes and thought of Anandpuram. His Amma called it a village, but to Mani it was home.He recalled the graceful sway of the tall palm trees and the vast roseblue sky. In the morning the gentle gusts of wind carried the wonderful smell of porottas cooking over charcoal fires. The winter months were the best. The cool air was nothing like the airconditioned air in Smart City’s buildings.No, wait, the rainy season was the best! It was such fun to watch the fat heavy warm droplets splishsplosh into the river Periyar. Oh, how he’d enjoyed sitting by the riverbank. So quiet, so peaceful. If only things could go back to the way they had been.“Waiting,” said the ShoeRack. Mani sat up with a sigh. He didn’t mind being given helpful hints, but this was too much. It was almost like being a prisoner and nobody, not even Amma, understood. Mani placed the Shoes on the ShoeRack and headed for the Kitchen. He had to warm the pakodas himself, but the FoodGenie brewed some chai. It tasted exactly like the kind of chai a machine would make. “Is the chai to your satisfaction, Manikantan?” asked the FoodGenie. “As good as cow urine.” “Thank you.”Mani’s Amulet beeped. It was his mother. She wanted to know whether he was feeling better. “How is your headache, kanna?” Her loving voice made Mani feel very sorry for himself. “The headache’s better, Amma. How’s work?” “Wonderful. It’s not like my old Anandpuram job at all. How was your day, kanna?” “Great.”His Amma worked so hard, such long hours, worried so much about him, cared so much. She was his mother and father and all the family he had in the world. He just didn’t have the heart to tell the truth. “I had a great day.” “You sure, Mani? Your SchoolBag told me you were sent to the Principal. What was that about?” “Nothing.” “Mani?” “Nothing! You can ask the Schoolbag. It seems to know everything.” “Mani, what’s the matter? Look, why don’t you go to the Mirror? I want to see you. Whatever the problem is, we can solve it.”“No, we can’t solve it!” Mani felt tears beginning to form. He tried to press back the tears but they kept coming like the rain on Periyar. He knew the House would report to his mother that her son was crying. Everything he did was watched and reported. He knew it was all for his own good and he knew Amma loved him, but sometimes, he wanted things to be. He closed his finger around the Amulet, and pulled the chain so hard, it snapped. Mani threw the Amulet into the Trash, and ignoring its shouting, ran out of the apartment. Mani didn’t know how long he ran or where he went or how exactly he got lost.Without the Amulet to guide him, he simply didn’t know where he was going. But the smart objects of the City had guessed he was lost and alerted the proper authorities. After his mother had thanked the nice policeman who brought him back, Mani took the Amulet from her. He was ashamed but also really glad to be back. “I have adjusted some of the settings,” said his mother. “The House will now give you a little more privacy. But it is really for your own good, Mani.” “I know,” mumbled Mani. “So how was it, your little adventure?” Mani shuddered. The streets had been filled with people but they were all somehow different. They were all strangers. With the Amulet, the streets were filled with many people he almost knew. Their names, the kind of music they liked, who their friends were, lots of fun stuff like that.Without the Amulet even simple things, like crossing the streets, had become difficult. There was no voice to tell him: “You can cross now, Manikantan.” And nobody knew him either. When he had passed the poster for the movie 'Mission Maut', the hero of the movie Vikram Seven said: “Hi, do you like action movies?” If he’d had the Amulet, Vikram would have said: “Hey Manikantan, nice to see you again, yaar, let’s talk.”Without the Amulet, every object was as stupid as a stone.“I thought so,” said his mother, with a small smile. “Now Mani, you know you shouldn’t have left the House without the Amulet? We were so worried!” “I’m sorry I broke the rules, Amma.” “That’s not always a bad thing, kanna. But you are a big boy now. You have to be more mature. Our life here is pretty happy, na?” Mani thought of Anandpuram. An Amulet would be pretty useless in Anandapuram. Maybe that wasn’t such a good thing. He nodded. His mother was very sweet. She prepared dinner by hand — well, mostly by hand, the FoodGenie helped, just a little.Then she read him a story as he drank his milk. Later she tucked him into bed, gave him a good night kiss, and touched her Amulet to his. He could tell Amma was very tired. “Good night, Amma.” “Good night, kanna.”“Good night, Manikantan, good night, Amma,” whispered the House. “Sleep tight, and I won’t let the bedbugs bite.”The Internet of Things Does your alarm clock know that you have exams tomorrow? Will it remind you to set the alarm so that you can get up early to do a final revision? If you are going somewhere and get lost, can your shoes give stepbystep directions? Of course not. Today, most of the objects we are surrounded are just objects. They don’t really know anything about you or the objects in the house. The clock is just a clock. The radio is just a radio. The clock does not know what the radio does and vice versa. They are not connected to you or to other people or to the objects in the world. But things are about to change. Soon, all humanmade objects will be interconnected. They will be more aware of what is going on around them. They will be smarter. They will be able to exchange data and keep track of your needs in a better way. When objects get interconnected and can communicate with each other, as if by an invisible telephone network, we say we have an Internet of Things. If it were up to you, would you like to live in Smart City or in Anandpur? Why?What if they all started talking? Count the number of objects in your home or classroom (door, chair, clock, radio, books, etc. ). Are you surprised by the number? Imagine how it would be if they could all see and hear and speak. How would your life change?"	./Story text files/151.txt	7733	15	5.863102998696219	632	135	147	45.59036144578313	102	64	26	9.512048192771084	86	80	430	337	5	1.39647577092511	813	95

This book is all about seals.The scientific name for a seal is a PINNIPED. Seals are a widespreadand diversegroupof fin footed,semiaquatic,marine mammals. Seals belong to the orderCarnivora. Theirclosest living relatives arebears, otters, weasels,and raccoons.There are three types of seal families: ●Odobenidae:whose only living (extant) member is thewalrus;●Otariidae:the eared seals( sea lionsand fur seals); and● Phocidae: the earless, or true seals.The smallest seal is the Baikal seal at around  metre (ft in) long and  kilograms (lbs). The biggest is the southern elephant seal, at over  m (ft) and  ton (, lb), making it also the largest carnivoran.Seals spend most of their lives in the water, but come ashore to mate, give birth, or escape from predators, like sharks and killer whales.Seals have streamlined bodies and four limbs in the form of flippers, that act as paddles in the water. They are not as fast in the water as dolphins, but much more flexible and agile.Fur seals and sea lions use their front limbs primarily to propel themselves through the water. Earless seals and walruses use their hind limbs to move through water.Fur seals, sea lions, and walruses have hind limbs that can be pulled under the body and used as legs on land. Travel for earless or true seals is more cumbersome on land, as they waddle along on their sea adapted flippers.Sea lions and fur seals (otariids) have visible external ears, while earless or true seals (phocids) and walruses lack these.Seals have welldeveloped senses—their eyesight and hearing are adapted for both air and water, and they have an advanced tactile system in their vibrissae (whiskers).Some types of seal are well adapted for diving to great depths, they have a layer of fat (blubber) under the skin to keep them warm. All species, except walruses, are covered in fur.Although seal species can be found all around the world, most prefer colder waters, in the higher latitudes or polar currents .Seals feed largely on fish and other small marine animals. A few, like the leopard seal, feed on larger animals such as penguins and other seals. Walruses are specialized for feeding on bottomdwelling sea life.Seal pups are typically born in the spring and summer months, females bear almost all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species stay on land, fasting, so as to nurse their young for short periods, while others take foraging trips to sea between nursing bouts. Walruses are known to nurse their young while at sea.Seals produce a number of sounds or vocalizations, like the loud barks of California sea lions, the gonglike calls of walruses, and the beautiful and complex songs of Weddell seals.The meat, blubber and fur coats of seals have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Seals are now protected from hunting by international law. Besides hunting, seals also face threats from accidental trapping, marine pollution, and conflicts with local people.The Japanese sea lion and the Caribbean monk seal have become extinct in the past century, while the Mediterranean monk seal and Hawaiian monk seal are ranked 'Critically Endangered' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.Seals have been endeared in various cultures worldwide. They are commonly kept in captivity and are may be trained to perform tricks and tasks.We hope you enjoyed all the seals! zSeal Classifications (Wikipedia)	./Story text files/425.txt	3423	25	6.716012084592145	228	103	236	96.82857142857142	6	29	37	16.742857142857144	6	29	123	208	8	1.7833333333333334	289	71
"Once upon a time, there was a little village. In the little village was a little stream.In the stream, several families of frogs, tortoises, and fish lived happily in each other's company. The fish family was the largest of them all.The fish family was also the most respected. The reason?A big fat radio that occupied pride of place in their underwater home.Grandpa Fish was the head of the fish family. He was obeyed in most things, not just by the younger fish but also by the frog and tortoise families.But there was one thing over which he simply had no control: the family radio.Never did Grandpa Fish get a chance to listen to the news.The younger fish, frogs, and tortoises simply adored film music, and would not move from the radio's side as long as it was playing.By the time he had convinced the younger ones to let him listen to the news, it was usually too late. Most often, all Grandpa Fish heard was the newscaster saying, “And that is the end of the news…” It was very annoying.One day, Grandpa managed to convince the younger ones a little earlier than usual. Rushing to the radio, he tuned in to the news, and heard the newscaster say, “And before we end, the headlines once again…” The Breaking News on the River Radio network that morning was very frightening.“A group of humans are using a new technique to capture the maximum number of fish possible!” said the newscaster. “They are poisoning the water of the rivers one by one! When the fish die, the humans just trap them all in their nets and take them away! They could be coming to your river very soon! ""Grandpa Fish was stunned. He quickly relayed the information to the rest of the fish and to the other river creatures. Numb with fear, everyone sat quietly thinking about the next course of action. No one wanted to listen to film music now.Meanwhile, the daughter of the village headman came to the river to fetch some water. Grandpa Fish and the headman had been friends for a long time.Swimming quickly to the surface, Grandpa Fish informed the girl that there was an emergency. ""Please tell your father to come and see me immediately, "" he said anxiously.The headman came at once. Grandpa Fish first made sure his guest was comfortable and even offered him a cup of coffee. Only then did he bring up the subject of the frightening news he had heard on the radio. Now the headman was worried too.Thinking quickly, he came up with a plan to make sure the river in his village, and all the creatures in it, would be safe.The headman quickly reassured the old fish and his clan. “Don’t worry, Grandpa Fish,” he said. “I will see to it that you and your fellow creatures will be safe from those terrible human beings.”The younger fish, frogs, and tortoises realized what a huge disaster it would have been had Grandpa Fish not listened to the news on the River Radio network that day.Ashamed of their earlier behaviour, they resolved to mend their ways in the future.Use your imagination and colour this picture any way YOU like.Use your imagination and colour this picture any way YOU like."	./Story text files/368.txt	3071	14	6.181184668989547	222	65	203	72.14285714285714	14	28	37	14.0	8	34	162	125	5	1.620253164556962	266	50
Spotty the Hyena is very sad. He has lost his laugh.“Please help me find my laugh, Giraffe.” “I can’t hear a laugh up here.”“Please help me find my laugh, Hippo.” “I can’t hear a laugh down here.”“Please help me find my laugh, Warthog.” “I can’t hear a laugh in here.”“Please help me find my laugh, Monkey.” “How did you lose it?”“When I laugh, you can see my big teeth. That makes everyone frightened,” said Spotty. “Then I got sad and my laugh just disappeared.”“I can’t find it anywhere!” “But you were looking in the wrong place.”Then she began to tickle Spotty all over. Monkey jumped out of the tree and picked up a feather.Slowly Spotty started smiling, and then he let out a big, loud laugh. He laughed and laughed until he was rolling around on the ground.All the other animals started laughing too.“Where did you find his laugh?” they asked. “His laugh was inside him all the time. I just made him happy and out it came.”They all laughed and laughed so that their teeth showed too. “I’ll never lose my laugh again,” said Spotty the happy Hyena.	./Story text files/459.txt	1054	15	5.990825688073395	90	19	68	38.074074074074076	22	5	13	7.962962962962963	17	10	74	35	4	1.2992125984251968	122	5
There was once a sparrow called Gubbi. One day, Gubbi went off to the market and bought herself a nice juicy guava. On the way back, the guava slipped from Gubbi’s beak and fell into a clump of thorns. Gubbi couldn’t bear the thought of losing her fruit. She decided she would get it back at any cost.First she went to a boy working nearby. “Little boy, little boy, please get my guava back for me,” she begged. “Can’t do it,” replied the boy. “Go away!”Gubbi was furious. She went straight to the farmer. She said, “I dropped my fruit in a clump of thorns. I asked the boy to help me but he didn’t. Now I want you to give him a good beating.” “Won’t do it,” said the farmer. “Go away!”Gubbi went straight to a cow that was grazing in the farmer’s pasture. She said, “I dropped my fruit in a clump of thorns. I asked the boy to help me but he didn’t. I asked the farmer to give the boy a beating but he didn’t. Now I want you to go and eat up the farmer’s crops.” “Can’t do it,” said the cow, and turned her head away.Gubbi flew straight to the fisherman. She said, “I dropped my fruit in a clump of thorns. The boy did not help me, the farmer did not help me, and the cow did not help me. Now I want you to whip the cow.” “Won’t do it,” said the fisherman and cast his net again.Gubbi went straight to the rat. She said, “I dropped my fruit in a clump of thorns. The boy did not help me, the farmer did not help me, the cow did not help me, and the fisherman did not help me. Now I want you to chew up the fisherman’s net.” “Can’t do it,” said the rat, and scurried away.Gubbi flew straight to the cat. She said, “I dropped my fruit in a clump of thorns. The boy did not help me, the farmer did not help me, the cow did not help me, the fisherman did not help me, and the rat did not help me. Now I want you to catch the rat.” “Won’t do it,” said the cat.Gubbi did not know what to do. She wished someone would do as she said. Suddenly, she remembered her friend, the ant. Gubbi knew he could help her get her fruit back.Gubbi flew straight to the ant’s house. When she saw him, she asked simply, “Will you bite a cat for me?” “Sure!” said the ant. “Show me where she is!”The ant kept his word and bit the cat. The cat went chasing after the rat and caught him. The rat quickly chewed up the fisherman’s net. The fisherman whipped the cow. The cow ate up all the farmer’s crops.The farmer gave the boy a beating. The boy picked up the guava that had fallen into the clump of thorns and gave it back to Gubbi. Gubbi was thrilled. She thanked her friend the ant with all her heart.Greedy Gubbi wanted to eat the guava immediately. She settled down on a branch for a feast. She had only had a small bite of it when something heavy fell on her head. A crow flying overhead with a big chunk of firewood in his beak had dropped it on Gubbi by accident. Gubbi fainted. And that is how naughty Gubbi was punished. And that is the end of the story.	./Story text files/360.txt	2940	12	5.296416938110749	265	42	137	45.682539682539684	40	23	32	10.26984126984127	24	39	203	104	5	1.2055555555555555	344	16

Bulli groaned and stretched, forcing her eyes open. It was .  in the morning and already dawn had crept into the room, spilling gently off her face on to the hard clay floor. The sun wakes up early in Assam and everyone is up and about at this hour. Outside, the family had started on their chores. She could hear her mother and Aaita, her grandmother, sweeping floors and fanning the kitchen fire.‘Buh buh buh buh…’ Bulli’s elder sister, Shanti, was calling the chickens in the courtyard to come and get their breakfast. Then there was a squawking, fluttering protest from the hens as Babu, her little brother, ran shrieking past—for no other reason, it would seem, than to scare the birds. Bulli knew she had better get up before someone came to fetch her. But she lay there a while longer, enjoying these last moments before the day came bustling in. Above her, three gailypainted cardboard butterflies flitted across the bamboo wall.Bulli’s house was made of bamboo, like all the houses in her village, Baghdhora Tila. It had bamboo beams and walls of strong woven bamboo matting. Even the doors and sliding windows were made of bamboo, as were the gate in front of the house, the fence around it, the tall bins in which the rice was stored, the tea strainer and the fish traps. Her father made baskets for a living. Bulli got up and went to greet her father. He sat by the door with Koka, her grandfather. There were rows of baskets stacked behind them. They looked grave. Odd, they weren’t working as they talked.She tried to catch her father’s attention. But Pita wasn’t really listening. ‘You’d better go and help your Aai, ’ he said absently. Something was very wrong. But even her usually cheerful Aaita seemed worried this morning. What could be the matter? Bulli quietly ate her breakfast, last night’s spicy lentil dhali —a weekly treat and got ready for school, wondering what was troubling everyone.‘Booleeee. O Booleee! ’ It was Aloka at the gate. Bulli threw a few dogeared books into her battered satchel and ran out. Bulli and Aloka had been friends forever. Their parents knew each other and it had been decided that Aloka’s older brother, Probir dada, would one day marry Bulli’s sister Shanti. So they were almost family. They told each other everything. Handinhand, the girls set off on the twokilometre trek to their school in the town. ‘Something’s wrong at home, ’ Bulli said. ‘The grownups are all acting very strangely. ’ ‘At my house too, ’ replied Aloka. ‘Probir da came home from the market yesterday very grumpy. He wouldn’t even talk to me. I wonder what’s bothering them. ’ ‘I know! I know! ’ They jumped, startled. It was Babu. For someone who couldn’t be still for a moment, Babu could certainly move silently when he chose. ‘What do you know? ’ asked Bulli. ‘What will you give me if I tell? ’ ‘A slap on your face if you don’t. ’Babu knew better than to mess with his sister when she used that tone. ‘They can’t get any more bamboo because the contractor is asking for too much money. Thousands of rupees. Pita does not have the money to bid directly for forest bamboo from the government. I heard them talking, ’ he blurted out as he danced jerkily ahead on the mud track. They walked on in silence. This was serious.In a while, they came to the outskirts of the town where the brick factory stood. A line of people stood at the gate, waiting to be let in. Bulli shivered. She had once carried bricks here with her parents when the money had run short and they had to work for wages to make ends meet. Now they might have to come back. No bamboo meant no baskets to make and sell. Her mind was racing as they got to school. Where could she get hold of bamboo for Pita’s baskets?Bulli was so deep in her thoughts that she hardly noticed the lessons go by. She hung her head, looking suitably repentant, when she was punished for not doing her homework. She rattled off the twelve times table with the rest of the class. She didn’t even squeal when Khagen, the rowdiest boy in school, sent a pellet from his rubberband catapult her way. During the lunch break, instead of joining the regular game of olugutitoluguti, Bulli huddled in a corner with Aloka, trying to figure out a way to help their families. The remaining lessons too went by in a blur. And when the gong sounded for the end of school, the two friends didn’t hang around the school compound as they usually did, but headed straight home. ‘Meet me in one hour by the hanging bridge, ’ Bulli told Aloka as they parted ways. Bulli had a plan. But she needed a sharp implement—like an axe or a knife. She knew where she could find one.Her grandmother was spreading amla to dry on a mat by the jars of lemons and olives pickling in the sun. ‘Aaita, where’s Pita? ’ Bulli tried to sound casual. Better not to arouse suspicion. Grownups had a way of stepping in and spoiling everything. ‘Gone to Guwahati with Probir da, to look for bamboo, ’ replied Aaita, swatting away her granddaughter’s hand from the sour gooseberries. Too late. Bulli had grabbed a handful, and scampered off. She found her grandfather in the work shed. Good, he was alone, at least for now. Babu was off somewhere–probably tormenting Shanti or playing pitthoo with his friends.‘Look, I’ve got something for you. ’ Koka’s eyes twinkled behind the thick lenses as he held out a perfect tiny basket. He had made her a whole collection of these toys—baskets in all shapes, little chairs, sofas, tables, even a dollsized bullock cart complete with canopy. ‘And what did my clever girl learn at school today? We’d better watch out or soon she will become a scholar and go to Delhi. And then she’ll become prime minister and start bossing us around. ’ Bulli giggled. ‘Koka, Koka, tell me a story. ’ She looked around the shed. The heap of bamboo stems, usually stacked almost to the ceiling, was now reduced to just a small pile. Koka expertly sliced a length of bamboo into smaller pieces. ‘And which one do you want to hear this time? ’ He used the sharp, broad blade of his daoto peel off the hard outer skin as he spoke. ‘The tiger story, the tiger story. ’ ‘Don’t you ever tire of hearing that one? ’In one quick move, Koka had halved a piece lengthwise. Shuk shuk shuk, with lightning speed the dao split the bamboo. Then a bend and a turn, and the fine, even strips fanned out between his fingers. These were for japis, the widebrimmed, upsidedown icecream cone hats that farmers wore while transplanting paddy. The rains were over this year, and the grain stood ripening in the fields. So these japis would be lined with patches of coloured felt or metallic paper, with trimmings of sequins, braid and baubles, to decorate the walls at festival time.Koka counted out five strips and crossed them over the tip of the mould he used to shape the crown. Bulli had seen him do this a thousand times, but she still watched as he wove more strips around and across the frame. The cone done, his fingers moved swiftly around the base, adding strips and weaving them to form the shade and then the turned down brim. Soon the outer layer of the japi was done — a net of fivepointed stars.He started on the inner layer. Bulli picked up a pair of scissors to cut the shiny paper into neat triangles for the trimming. In the corner, she spied Pita’s dao. Excellent! Now all she had to do was smuggle it out of the house. Koka finished the inner lining of the japi. He arranged the papers Bulli handed him and sandwiched them between the two layers. Slightly wider bamboo strips were placed across the underside of the shade for strength. Then a hoop around the base of the cone and another around the rim, secured with string to hold the layers in place, and it was ready. All that was left now was to glue on some sequins and a length of braid around the brim.And as they worked, Koka told his story. ‘A long time ago…’ ‘How long? ’ Bulli wanted to know. ‘Don’t interrupt, child… ‘It was in my koka’s koka’s koka’s pita’s time–maybe even before that. There were only five houses by the river, with the hill behind and the jungle all around. The people grew rice and vegetables for themselves, and whatever little was extra they sold in the market.‘One year, the rains fell harder than usual. The sky was black as coal, even in the morning. The sun fell asleep, thinking it was night. The rain kept pouring down. The river rose, higher and higher, until the dam burst and the water flooded over into the fields towards our village.‘And still the downpour continued. The water was kneehigh by now and still rising. The people were afraid. They huddled together, wet and hungry. If they didn’t do something soon, their belongings would be washed away and they would drown. ‘Then they heard it. Brroouuaarrrrr… aabrrooaarrr… so loud that the rain stopped and the sun peeped out from behind the clouds to see what was going on.Way up, on the top of the hill stood a tiger–handsome, huge, his coat glistening like pure gold. He was calling to them. Brroouuaarrrrr… aabrrooaarrr… come up heeerrreerr …’ ‘But tigers can’t speak our language, ’ Bulli cut in. ‘Have you ever met a tiger? ’ She had to admit that she hadn’t. ‘Then how do you know they can’t? ’ he asked.‘At first the people were afraid to go. They’d never been up the hill before and they weren’t sure that this wasn’t a trick. They certainly didn’t want to become a tasty meal for some wild animal. ‘The tiger saw them hesitate. Brroouuaarrrrr… aabrrooaarrr… come up heeerrreerr wherrrre it’s dry and safe… He roared again, trying to sound as friendly as he could. ‘This time they went. They hadn’t much choice. The tiger came halfway down the slope to lead them safely to the top. The villagers followed him. They were not afraid any more. He was a kind tiger. He had saved them from the flood. ‘Up on the hill, there were ponds and streams full of fish, plenty of fruit trees and bamboo groves. The villagers were pleased to find such a beautiful spot to build their new homes. But now something else troubled them. Their fields were left far behind, at the bottom of the hill. What would they do for a living? ‘Ahem, aabrrooaarrr… I couldn’t help overhearing… If you’ll perrrmitt me to make a suggestion… It was the tiger who had been standing nearby and was as wellmannered as he was kind. Follow me, if you please. He led them to a bamboo grove. There’s plenty of bamboo here for you to use. It’s strong and waterproof — good for building houses and supple enough to make baskets, which you can sell in the market. People always need baskets in which to carry and store.There’s plenty of bamboo here for you to use. It’s strong and waterproof —good for building houses and supple enough to make baskets, which you can sell in the market. People always need baskets in which to carry and store. ‘With one sweep of a front paw the tiger knocked down a stem and shredded it into strips with his claws. Then he showed them how to weave mats and baskets. And then he was gone. He disappeared into the thick jungle. But they knew he was watching them from behind the trees.‘So they set about rebuilding their village, which they named Baghdhora Tila, in honour of the bagh, the tiger, on the tila, the hill, who saved them from the flood and taught them a new craft. ‘And that is how we came to be here and to weave baskets for a living. ’ ‘What happened to the tiger? ’ Bulli was getting restless by now, but she knew she was expected to ask. ‘Oh, he’s still around. Lives in the forest and watches over the village. They say he appears every once in a while to help us in times of trouble. ’ Bulli stood up. ‘I have to get the fish, ’ she said by way of explanation. She went over to the corner where the tools were kept and made a big show of putting away the scissors and metallic paper. When she left the work shed, she was carrying, hidden in the folds of her skirt, her father’s dao. Bulli picked up her gear. She and Aloka went out every afternoon to get fish for dinner. It was part of their daily routine, so no one paid much heed. Bulli hid the dao in the fish basket and ran out.Aloka was already at the hanging bridge that stretched and swayed across the stream separating the jungle from their village. ‘Did you get it? ’ she asked. ‘It’s here, ’ Bulli patted the basket at her waist. ‘Let’s get the fish first, ’ she added. The hillside was dotted with shallow ponds, teeming with silvery fish that fed on the water plants. Bulli and Aloka dipped their bamboo bottleshaped fish catchers into one, then lifted them out. They picked out the weeds and threw the fish into their baskets. Soon their baskets were full.The girls headed back towards the hanging bridge. The plan was to go into the jungle and bring back some bamboo for their parents. Finding the bamboo would be no problem. It grew in thick clumps all over the forest. Bulli and Aloka were sure they could carry the bamboo back to the village. They’d balanced five bricks each on their heads during their time at the factory. How they would get it into their houses without being found out was entirely another matter. Their luck had held so far. They could only pray that their parents would be so happy to see the bamboo that they wouldn’t think to ask how it got there. Pleased with their clever plan, the two friends crossed into the forest.Oh no! They weren’t alone. Babu and Khagen were kicking a dented plastic ball around the clearing. Bulli and Aloka slipped quietly past them, behind the trees, only to run into Sangeeta, with her small brother Uppal in tow, collecting firewood. ‘Where are you going? ’ Sangeeta asked. ‘To get some bamboo. ’ ‘We’re coming too. ’ The sister and brother joined the team.The girls didn’t argue. There wasn’t much time before sundown. Silently, they filed through the thick undergrowth, until they came upon a dense grove of bamboo. Bulli took out the dao. She’d never used one before, but trying to look as if she did this every day, she touched its sharp blade to the stem. There was a crunch and a thud behind them. They froze. ‘Whoooo, whoooo I’m the ghost of the jungle. What are you doing on my land? ’ They laughed, halfrelieved. Babu and Khagen had found them. ‘Here, you’d better give me that. I know how to use these things. ’ Khagen made a grab for the dao. ‘Shhh! ’ Aloka put her finger to her lips. They heard a rustling in the trees. Something moved. This was beginning to get scary. Uppal let out a howl. ‘I don’t like this place. I want to go home. ’ Bulli, the bravest of them all, took command. ‘Sangeeta, tell your brother to shut up. Babu, stop fidgeting! I’m going to have a look. ’With a bit of shoving, the group squatted on the ground watching intently as Bulli moved towards the sound. The rustling grew louder. A twig snapped. They distinctly saw a yellow stripe flash past. Bulli’s courage disappeared. She turned and ran. The others followed, their hearts pounding. They didn’t stop until they reached the bridge. ‘Where’s the dao? ’ Bulli asked Khagen panting. ‘I don’t know. I thought you had it. ’ ‘Well, we’d better go back and look for it. ’ ‘You go—it’s your dao. ’ Khagen’s brashness scarcely disguised the panic in his voice. Only Aloka was willing to go with Bulli. They held hands as they retraced their steps through the jungle. The dao lay where Khagen had dropped it. And there next to it was a broken stem of bamboo. ‘So that’s what got those scaredycats so frightened! ’ they laughed.Dusk was falling. The birds were calling to each other from their roosts. The frogs croaked and splashed in the ponds and the crickets had already started their chirruping. Soon the night would swoop down on them. They girls knew they had better get home soon. It took them a while to realize they were lost. One wrong turn somewhere had taken them deeper into the jungle than they had ever been before. Bulli and Aloka clung to each other trembling, wondering which way to go.Then they heard it. A slow, majestic swish. Everything else had gone silent. They strained to get a better look in the halflight. This was no bamboo stem. Could it be? A flash of a gold and brown striped tail? Bulli remembered Koka’s story. They must follow the sound. Trustingly, they went with the crackle, pop, swish, through the thick foliage, on to the track leading to the hanging bridge. They couldn’t see much​ ​—just the hint of a whisker, the twitch of an ear and, once, a glint of kind amber eyes that seemed to say, No need to worry. I will show you the way.The girls turned to thank their friend—but there was no one there. Just the jungle noise behind them and the village lights up ahead. Bulli said goodnight to Aloka, and ran off. They would talk about what they had seen tomorrow. She had to get home and put the dao in its usual place before it was missed.She had just replaced the dao and was handing the fish to Aai with some excuse about being so late, when they heard the gate open. Pita was back from Guwahati. He was smiling. The family crowded round him, eager to hear the news. ‘We found a dealer in the city willing to sell us bamboo at the old price if we bought a large enough quantity, ’ he said happily. ‘So we ordered enough for all the basket weavers. They’ll be sending a truck tomorrow. ’Bulli was bursting to tell her own story. So, amid all the excitement, without being asked, she announced to no one in particular, ‘Aloka and I met a tiger in the jungle today. ’ Everybody laughed. ‘Don’t be silly, ’ said Shanti in her best older sister tone. ‘There aren’t any tigers here any more. ’ Bulli looked at her grandpa. He didn’t say anything. But behind the spectacles she saw the wink and smiled.

“Nivi! Turn the cooker off after three whistles, okay?” Ma says. Ma is going to the market to buy vegetables for dinner.Nivi makes a face. THUMP! She puts her book down. PWFFT! She sticks her tongue out at the cooker.Nivi taps her foot on the floor. She waits and waits for the whistle to blow.All of a sudden, she has an idea!Nivi picks up the rolling pin and places it close to the gas knob. She arranges a row of tomatoes and potatoes behind it.The rasamanddal ladle is next. Nivi keeps it carefully at the edge of the shelf above the cooker.She then makes five of Nani’s spoons stand up. These are the ones Nani uses to sip her watery khichdi.Finally, Nivi places her favourite plastic ball right above the spout of the pressure cooker.WHOOSH! The ball moves a little. WHOOSH! A little more. WHOOSH! The ball rolls down the third time. Nivi jumps, claps, and whistles herself!The ball hits the spoons. The spoons fall on the ladle. The ladle swings off the shelf. BLOOONG!The ladle hits the potatoes. The potatoes roll into the tomatoes. The tomatoes crash into the rolling pin. The rolling pin hits the knob of the stove. THAAD!The knob turns. The stove switches off. Nivi opens the pressure cooker carefully. Inside it is yummy, perfectly cooked rice.Nivi goes back to reading her book happily.Build Your Own Genius Machine Nivi builds a type of machine called the Rube Goldberg machine. This is a machine that works on the principle of cause and effect. This is what happens when you hit a coin with a striker on the carrom board and it, in turn, smashes into another, causing the second coin to land in a pocket! In a Rube Goldberg machine, a series of objects that carry out simple tasks work together to meet a common goal in a very complex way. Sure, it’s simpler to do things the easy way, but building a machine to do them is more fun.Try your hand at building your own Rube Goldberg machine to drop a teaspoon. Here’s how. You will need:  thin book rolled up as a cylinder,  smooth long sticks for a slope,  thick books,  rulers,  marker,  eraser,  ball,  notebooks,  light plastic jar, a bundle of string,  teaspoon,  vessel,  smooth beamSlide the cylinder down a slope. The cylinder hits two books, placed standing up. They fall on a ruler, which is balanced on a marker. This, in turn, tips a ball. The ball hits three notebooks. They land on the edge of the second ruler, balanced on an eraser. A jar, placed on the other end of the ruler, is attached to a piece of string. The string is looped around a smooth beam above. The free end of the string is tied to a spoon. The jar rises when the third notebook falls on the ruler. The string falls down, dropping the spoon into the vessel.	./Story text files/520.txt	2704	16	5.93950177935943	227	54	248	44.847457627118644	41	18	52	9.457627118644067	33	26	151	130	4	1.3214285714285714	306	30

The sun had just set, and the forest was in darkness. A huge lizardlike creature was hiding in the bushes. It was still as a statue, from the tip of its snout to the curve of its tail. Only its sharp eyes moved, darting left and right. Its nostrils twitched as it smelled dinner. A juicy little insect! The giant lizard got ready to pounce when . . .Suddenly, the ground rumbled and shook. Animals were running in all directions. The poor lizardcreature was almost run over. Angrily, it turned back to see what was causing all the confusion. GULP! A terrifying beast was charging down the forest path. It was taller than the tallest trees, and had skin as rough as rock. Oh no! Was the hunter about to become the prey?This is NOT a story. Such creatures actually lived on earth a long, long time ago. At a time when there were no humans or dogs or birds. Instead there were mammoths, dinosaurs, giant insects, and even ferocious fishlike creatures in the oceans. There were also strangelooking plants!How do we know this? Because of science. A very special branch of science called ‘Palaeontology’ (pronounced payleeontoloji) that is related to the history of Earth. Palaeontology is the study of plants and animals that lived on earth many, many years ago. And paleontologists are scientists who study this science. Just as the ruins of an old palace can tell us things about a king from the past (like how grand his throne was, or what his favourite weapon was), there are clues deep inside the earth that can tell us many things about ancient animals. The clues come in many forms—bones, footprints, eggs, and sometimes even the body of an entire animal preserved in stone!These animals lived millions and millions of years ago, even before apes or humans appeared on earth! How did they not rot and decay? And how are they still preserved? Well, when these creatures died and as they rotted, they got buried under layers and layers of soil. The skin and flesh decayed and disappeared, but the hard bones and teeth remained because of the tightly packed soil. All these layers of soil, along with the bones, became hard and turned into rock! Such rocks are called fossils.When scientists first discovered huge bones buried under the surface of the earth, they did not know what these were. The bones were larger than any animal they had ever known. Bones as long as tree trunks, skulls the size of autorickshaws, teeth as big as icecream cones, and claws like knives! They kept putting the bones together in different ways to see if they could come up with an animal they recognised. Finally, it all clicked into place, like a puzzle.Paleontologists can tell a lot about an animal from its skeleton. For example, if the bones of the legs are larger than the bones of the hands, it is possible that this animal walked on two legs. Just like that gigantic creature we met earlier! That fearsome creature is called Tyrannosaurus Rex (TRex for short! ). If the bones of all the legs are equal in size, there is a good chance that this animal walked on all fours – like the Diplodocus which had four stout legs and a really long neck.Fossils of their teeth give great clues about what ancient creatures liked to eat. Many skeletons had long, sharp teeth which are good for eating meat. Some skeletons had only flat, broad, smooth teeth. They were good for chewing leaves and the bark of trees. So we know that there were some vegetarian dinosaurs too! But scientists don’t always find entire skeletons. They discover only a few bones, maybe a finger here, a rib there, or maybe just a couple of bones from the back.Not all fossils are bones. Some are just marks, like footprints we leave when we walk on soft mud. Dinosaurs left footprints too, and before these prints could disappear, the soil got covered with layers of sand and rock. So the prints stayed intact for millions of years! In fact, by measuring the distance between footprints, paleontologists can guess the height of the animal. They can also tell how it stood and walked.Some of the strangest fossil marks were left by plants. Paleontologists have discovered interestinglyshaped leaves and flowers that cannot be seen anywhere today.But here’s the most fun clue of all! Any idea what this might be? Is it a football? Is it a cannonball? Is it an egg? That’s right! It’s an egg! A giant fossilized egg. Scientists have found whole eggs that even contain the outline of an unhatched baby dinosaur inside! Perhaps they got buried in a landslide or lava from a volcano before they could hatch. In Mongolia, scientists discovered eggs along with the skeleton of an adult dinosaur in an attacking pose. They thought that the big dinosaur, fancying an omelette for breakfast, had come to eat the eggs. They named it Oviraptor, meaning ‘egg hunter’.Soon, they started discovering many fossilized eggs close to Oviraptor skeletons in different poses. They realised that it was actually the mother dinosaur protecting her own eggs, and not trying to eat them! Most unfairly, the name Oviraptor stuck. As you might have guessed, we don’t know everything about these creatures yet. There are a lot of clues that don’t really fit, and some clues were put together all wrong! Scientists are still trying to figure them out. There is a lot of digging to be done! Would you like to be a paleontologist and help solve some mysteries? What are you waiting for? Grab a shovel!Meet some other fascinating creatures from the past. Woolly Mammoth These animals were related to elephants, and had tusks that were  feet long!Ichthyosaurs These creatures looked like fish but they were actually reptiles that lived in the sea. The name ichthyosaur means ‘fish lizard’ in Greek. Bear dogs These animals were neither bears nor dogs, but a group of animals related to both bears and dogs.	./Story text files/153.txt	5825	22	6.252268602540835	414	137	237	62.32608695652174	37	55	47	11.98913043478261	33	59	331	220	7	1.5686900958466454	515	111

Bzzz…Hey, what’s all that buzz about? Is it a code word used by bees to call their friends? Or a hum of excitement when honey is spotted?Bees, particularly bumble bees, make a loud buzzing sound as they fly. The sound is made when the wings beat up and down. The smaller the wings, the faster the bees have to beat them in order to fly. And the quicker they beat, the louder the buzz.Bees also buzz to do something very useful; they carry pollen from one flower to the other like a postman delivering letters.Pollen is the powdery grain on flowers. Pollen helps plants to make seeds. Bees are excellent pollinators. Thanks to them, many new plants grow and sprout all around.How do those tiny grains of pollen stick to the bees' feet? When bees sit on a flower to suck honey, the grains of pollen stick to their feet and bodies.Then when the same bees buzz near a flower and perform a lively dance, the quivering shakes the pollen off on other flowers. The bees then fly to other flowers where they leave the pollen behind to pick up new ones and this process continues.Bees are the buzzing godfathers of many new plants that grow away from the parent tree.Can you hear your own breath? Usually not. But you can hear a bee breathing. That is because the buzz is also the sound of the bee breathing. It has a small, segmented body so when it breathes, the air gets on a roller coaster ride through all those bumpy parts inside and creates a buzz. Sounds pretty exciting, doesn’t it? Aren’t those busy bees truly amazing?DID YOU KNOW? . Bees are hard workers. In winter, they can live up to nine months and in summer only up to two months. All work and no play does not make them dull. . A curious case of the bees is that when they do the work of a younger bee, their brain stops ageing. It starts working like a younger bees’ brain. Do you now wish you were a bee? . Bees recognize faces just like human beings do. Each part of the face is first taken separately, then put together to make up the face. Remember not to anger a bee!. Caffeine, a chemical used by plants to keep away harmful insects, helps bees remember the location of the flower. It welcomes the bees for a second visit. . Bumble bees are larger than honey bees and other types of bees. They live in hives and love to socialise. Many bumble bees do not have a sting. They may not produce much honey but are excellent pollinators.Be a bee! . A honey bee performs a dance that tells the rest of the hive where to find nectar. Now try to express some information through dance moves, and see if your friends are able to understand what you are communicating! . Try buzzing like a bee. . . flap your arms and see if you can hear a buzz.. A honeycomb, the house of the bees, is known to be a masterpiece of engineering. Why do you think? Try and draw perfect hexagons as in a honeycomb. Or make models using ordinary cartons. Maybe you’ll guess the answer then! . Try to carefully smell different flowers. You could then imagine how honey made from the nectar of different flowers can also taste different.	./Story text files/74.txt	3068	14	5.651898734177215	261	55	146	46.953125	41	23	29	9.921875	30	34	202	114	5	1.358695652173913	326	42
"This is Bunu’s first loose tooth. She is excited, but also a little scared. “I have a wiggly tooth, Mama!”""Push it with your tongue,” Mama says. Bunu pushed and pushed and pushed. “It is not ready,” Mama says. “Wait for some time and it will fall out on its own.”Bunu goes to Papa. “Papa,” Bunu says. “I have a wiggly tooth!” Papa shakes the tooth gently. ""It is not ready,” he says. ""Wait for some time and it will fall out on its own. ""But Bunu does not want to wait. She runs to her room with a long piece of string. She ties one end of the string around her tooth and the other around the door knob.Bunu sits on the floor and waits and waits and waits.Finally Bunu gets tired of waiting and waiting and waiting. She unties the string from the door and sits on her bed with a loud sigh.Chunnu, her sister, walks in after some time. “That was a terrible idea,” she says, pointing at the door. “Why don’t I pull the string, and your tooth will come out like that?”Chunnu snapped her fingers. Bunu closes her eyes and opens her mouth. ""One, two, three! "" Chunnu pulls. ""OWWW!” Bunu screams. ""It is not ready,” Chunnu says. ""Wait for some time and it will fall out on its own. ""“This tooth will never come out!” Bunu says. ""When we were small, we would throw our teeth on the roof and ask Musa to give us his in return,” says Mama. “Because we wanted teeth as strong as a mouse’s.” Bunu runs out and cries, “Musa, Musa! Here is my big strong tooth for you. If you like it, please come and take it away!”That night, Bunu dreams of a big mouse. Musa is holding something gleaming between his teeth. He stops and stares at her, then scurries away into a hole.As soon as Bunu wakes up, she pushes the tooth with her tongue. But there is nothing there! Did she swallow it?

"Pehelwaan ji exercised every day.One day, he wanted to be a player. He went to the field and said to the children, “I want to play with you.” The children were scared of him. So they could not say no to him!When Pehelwaan kicked the ball it almost burst. When he kicked it again, the goalkeeper went flying!The children did not know what to do.Gappu said, “Pehelwaan ji, let us play cricket.” Pehelwaan ji said, “Yes, but I will bat first.”Gappu ran, and jumped high as he threw the ball.Pehelwaan ji lifted the bat. He lost his balance. The ball hit his head. Ouch!Pehelwaan said, “Now, I will bowl.” Gappu said, “Fine Pehelwaan ji, but please do not jump high when you bowl. That will scare me.”Pehelwaan did not listen to Gappu. He jumped high.He lost his balance and fell down. THUD!He got up and said, ""I will field now. "" Gappu nodded his head.Gappu turned his bat this way and that. The ball went all over the field. Zipp, zapp, zipp, zoom. Pehelwaan ji huffed and puffed as he ran after it. OHH, AAAH, HMMPH.Pehelwaan ji was very tired. He pulled a face and said, “This is not for me! I will be the wicketkeeper.” Gappu agreed.Gappu threw the ball up high. The batsman ducked. Pehelwaan ji could do nothing as the ball went straight into his mouth. . . GUPP!“Forget it. I don’t want to play!” said Pehelwaan ji. He was in bad shape as he ran away. Gappu pulled out a new ball and everybody went back to the game peacefully."	./Story text files/320.txt	1431	15	5.55	130	30	75	30.822222222222223	39	6	17	6.844444444444444	33	12	95	65	5	1.2751322751322751	171	18

Her chosen career is as a professional pilot, she has worked in a variety of aviation capacities from instruction to airline flying, and is the author of several aviation text books. Danielle started writing children's books as a creative outlet from the stress of her 'day job' and as a break from the sometimes monotonous work required for her professional writing. She began with the Mac and Dipper series, aimed at  year olds, inspired by two of her own dogs. After having children of her own, she suddenly found she had a muse, an eager resource for test reading, and, by benefit of age, an honest critic. It was fun and rewarding to write creative stories to match her children's learning curve. Danielle prefers to write for the 'learning to read' group, centred around a reading age of  to  years. Because of her passion for children's literature, and the role it plays in literacy standards, all of Danielle's books are available free in ebook versions. This also led Danielle to create the website 'Free Kids Books' to share free good quality childrens books with the community, in contribution to improved literacy standards world wide.

"“A perfect day for a walk!” thinks Mr. Centipede. “What better way to keep my  feet strong and fit?” At the end of each foot, Mr. Centipede wears a bold, bright, beautiful, boot. That is  pairs of boots for all  feet!Whom does he first meet, but Dame Damsel Fly? ""What big boots you have on, "" she says. ""Tell me, Mr. Centipede, which leg do you place before which, when you go walking? "" ""Why this leg of course!” says Mr. Centipede, lifting leg number . ""Wait! Actually, this leg!” He lifts leg number .“Such fine boots!” says the Big Beetle. “Tell me, Mr. Centipede, which leg do you place before which, when you go walking?”“What a silly question,” says Mr. Centipede annoyed. He sticks out leg number . And puts it down quickly. He sticks out leg number  instead.“What is happening here?” asks Elder Ant. “Shhh! Poor Mr. Centipede is very confused,” whispers Dame Damsel Fly. “In all this time, even though he has so many boots, he has been unable to take a single step.”“Is that so?” says Elder Ant with a sigh. ""Tell me, Mr. Centipede, which leg do you place before which, when you go for a walk. ""“I start simply with this one…” says Mr. Centipede, lifting leg number . “Oh nooo! I mean… that one.” He lifts leg number . “Oh noooo! None of them. I mean, one of them. Oh nooo! I have forgotten what I mean!”“Run, run quickly!” they hear a voice. “Who is that?” cries Big Beetle. “I am Stick Insect. You, with all those boots, had better run.”“I have spotted a blackbird,” whispers Stick Insect. “She seems quite hungry and ready for breakfast. She cannot see me because I look like the tree bark I am resting on. But she sure can see you, dressed up in those big bright colourful boots! Run, run quickly!” “HAHAHA!” The Stick Insect laughs. “What is so funny?” asks Lady Spider, who just swung by for a visit.“There was no blackbird!” says Stick Insect. “It was just a trick to have some fun. And make all those boots run! You will agree, now that it is done Mr. Centipede sure can run!”Isn't it funny that Mr Centipede was finding it difficult to take a single step but had no trouble running? This could happen to any of us! There are things we do every day without realising – like blinking, or moving our hands while talking. But if we pay careful attention to how often we blink or in what way our hands move, we may get confused. This is called the Centipede's Dilemma or Humphrey's Law."	./Story text files/102.txt	2400	14	5.370909090909091	229	46	107	31.89041095890411	61	12	23	7.109589041095891	52	21	154	121	4	1.180232558139535	318	26
"""Ranju, can you get me two coconuts from that basket? "" Ranjita raced to the other side of the room. She returned in an instant with the two coconuts. Amma was pleased. ""Thank you, darling! You are such a help. "" Ranjita glowed with pride. It was a BIG day today  her uncle Mahesh Chikkappa's wedding! And she had a BIG responsibility  to hand over mithai boxes to the  guests after lunch.But where were the mithai boxes? ""Oh no! "" cried Amma. ""The boxes are still in the room upstairs! Run and bring them down quickly, Ranju. The guests have almost finished their lunch. "" ""Amma, you never ask ME for help! "" said a small, whiny voice. ""And I'm hungry. "" ""You can help Akka, Vikky, "" said Amma soothingly. ""Ranju, take him with you, please? "" Ranjita frowned. Why did Amma always do this? Her little brother Vikram was SO annoying! But there was no time to argue.""You have to listen to me and do exactly as I say, Vikky! "" she warned him, making her eyes big and stern. Vikram nodded. ""I will, Akka! Promise! ""Upstairs, in a corner, were a pile of cloth bags. Ranjita pulled open a bag. There were several small mithai boxes inside. ""It will take too long to empty all the bags and count out  boxes, Akka! "" Vikram was very worried. ""And I'm very hungry. "" ""Shhhh! "" said Ranjita fiercely. ""Let me think! ""Ranjita thought hard. Vikram was right. It would take too long to actually count out  boxes. They couldn't take all the bags down either. There were too many of them. Vikram looked longingly at the mithai boxes. ""Can I open one? I'm VERY hungry. """"NO! "" said Ranjita. Then she smiled. ""Idea! We don’t need to take EXACTLY  mithai boxes! We can take APPROXIMATELY . That will be much quicker. "" ""Approximately? "" Vikram looked puzzled. ""What does that mean, Akka? "" ""It means a few MORE than, or a few LESS than, the exact number, "" said Ranjita. ""Buut, "" Vikram said slowly, ""If we take less than , there won't be enough for everyone. """"So we take more! "" said Ranjita. ""Ok, let’s do it! "" Vikram grabbed a few bags. ""Quick! I'm very, VERY hungry! "" ""Wait, silly! Let me tell you HOW to approximate first! "" said Ranjita. She poured out all the boxes from one bag onto the floor and counted them. ""See, Vikky, "" she said. ""There are  mithai boxes in this bag. "" Vikram nodded.Ranjita pointed to the other bags. ""All the bags are approximately, more or less, the same size. What does that tell you? "" Vikram shrugged. ""It tells you that each bag has approximately, more or less,  mithai boxes! "" said Ranjita. ""Oh THAT! "" said Vikram airily. ""I knew THAT. ""Ranjita hid her grin. ""Tell me this, then. How many mithai boxes in two bags? "" ""Approximatelymoreorless *, "" said Vikram instantly. ""And in three bags? "" ""Approximatelymoreorless **! "" Vikram began to smile. He was getting the hang of this. ""And in five? "" ""Approximatelymoreorless ***! "" yelled Vikram. ""And  is half**** of all the mithai boxes we need! "" *( x  = ), **( x  = ) ***( x  = ) **** (Half of  =  /  = )""That's very good, Vikky! "" said Ranju admiringly. Vikram turned red with delight. He loved it when his Akka praised him. ""Now can I open a mithai. . . "" Ranjita glared. ""I mean, "" Vikram said quickly, ""I will take  bags with approximately moreorless  boxes, and you take . Okay? """"Not so fast! "" said Ranjita. ""We haven't counted the boxes in every bag. What if one or two bags have only  boxes? We won't have enough for everyone then. ""Vikram paused. As usual, Akka was right. ""So we take  bags, then? "" he asked slowly. ""With approximatelymore orless  mithai boxes? "" ""Exactly! "" said Ranjita. ""You take  bags, and I will take . Come on! "" The children ran down the stairs with the bags. Amma was waiting anxiously. She was very relieved to see them. ""That was quick! "" said Amma. ""Are you sure we have enough for everyone? "" ""Yes, Amma, "" said Vikky. ""I am very, very sure. AND. . . I'm very, very, VERY hungry. ""When all the guests had left, Amma hugged Ranjita and Vikram. ""You both saved the day! "" she said. Then she narrowed her eyes. ""I've never seen you both work so well together, "" she said. ""Does that mean you finally like each other? "" Ranjita and Vikram laughed. ""Approximatelymoreorless! "" they said, as they ran to lunch.Ranjita and Vikram used a clever mathematical trick to get their job done quickly. They called it 'Approximately More or Less'; mathematicians call it 'Estimation'. THE GUESSING GAME So what is Estimation? Is it like guessing? Sort of, but estimation is 'intelligent' guessing. Why is estimation important? Estimation helps you identify wrong answers quickly. For instance, let's say you have just  seconds to answer this question: . What is  x ? a.  b.  c.  d.  You know that  x  =  (anything into ten is the same number with a zero at the end). So  x  should be LESS than that. That means Options (a) and (c) are wrong. Option (d) seems too small to be the right answer   x  should be closer to . So you pick Option (b). See how estimation has helped you pick the right option, simply by identifying the wrong ones?Estimation helps alert you to reallife errors. When the shopkeeper totals your bill, you can tell instantly if it is wrong because you have estimated approximately how much it should be. Estimation helps you calculate distances. If you know that you cover  cm with each step, and that you take  steps to walk from home to the library, you can estimate the distance between the two ( x  cm =  cms =  m, which is about half a kilometre). Estimation is fun. How many peas inside half a kilo of unshelled pods? How many elephants should you stand on top of each other to make the height of your flagpole? You can find out answers to all kinds of wacky questions using estimation!"	./Story text files/140.txt	5711	25	5.231927710843373	560	104	206	33.61818181818182	133	32	49	7.587878787878788	117	48	375	289	9	1.2781065088757397	758	87

Anaya’s most favorite thing in the world is her thumb. She loves her round, thick and blobby thumb as it sits in her mouth. She sucks it in bed, she sucks it in class and she sucks it on the swing. She sucks it all the time! Her parents don’t like it much and are always saying, ‘Your thumb smells’, ‘Anaya stop! ’, ‘Anaya don’t! ’Anaya is at the zoo today. Her parents do not look at her thumb since they are busy looking at the animals. Anaya sees an elephant. She spots a calf that is not splashing with his mother. He is not trumpeting with his father. He is not eating bananas with his friends. What is the baby elephant doing? Sucking his trunk! CHUSK! CHUSK!Just ahead are some deer. Anaya sees a fawn that is not munching with her mother. She is not looking at other animals like her father. She is not prancing with her friends. What is the baby deer doing? Sucking her hoof! CHUSK! CHUSK!Next, the monkeys call out. Anaya spots an infant who is not clinging to her mother. She is not playing the clown with her father. She is not playing hide and seek with her friends. What is the baby monkey doing? Sucking her thumb! CHUSK! CHUSK!Anaya spots hippos in the water. She sees a hippopotamus calf that is not yawning wide with her mother. She is not grunting with her father. She is not swimming with her friends. What is the baby hippo doing? Sucking her lip! CHUSK! CHUSK!The tigers welcome her with a growl. And look at that tiger cub! He is not snoozing with his mother. He is not swatting flies with his father. He is not sneaking up on his friends. What is the baby tiger doing? Sucking his tail! CHUSK! CHUSK!Anaya sits down and thinks of the baby animals that are missing all the fun. Anaya looks at the people around her. She sees a boy on his father's shoulders waving his arms. She sees a boy carrying cotton candy and a juice can.She sees a girl clicking pictures with a camera. She sees a baby shaking her rattle. All the children are having fun! Anaya looks down her nose and sees her own hand curled up, with the thumb in her mouth. Could she put her thumb to better use?Anaya pulls her thumb out of her mouth, runs ahead and stops between her parents. She holds onto their hands, counts , jumps up and swings high in the air. “WHEEE!” And the little baby monkey watching her from above does the same.	./Story text files/308.txt	2324	12	5.828703703703703	180	36	87	35.904761904761905	45	18	19	7.920634920634921	39	24	130	86	5	1.2030075187969924	255	11
Diya came home after playtime with her friends. “PAAA!” she called out.Pa ran into the kitchen. He hurriedly picked up a basket of peas and started to shell them.Pa had never gone to school. So Diya had taken it upon herself to teach him. Of all the subjects, Pa enjoyed geography the most. He liked topics related to farming  soil, crops, rainfall, rivers and maps. (Map of India on pg  not to scale. Artistic representation only. )But today was Maths Day.“Pa, you can’t run away from maths,” said Diya. Pa continued to shell peas. “Maths is very important, Pa. We’ll be learning division today.”“Diya, I’m busy. Can’t you see?” said Pa. Pa was always ‘busy’ on Maths Days. He would suddenly have to clean the house or paint the walls or write letters to distant relatives.“I have to cook dinner,” said Pa. “Okay, Pa. I’ll help you. Give me some pea pods,” said Diya. Pa gave her half the pods.“See, you just did division!” said Diya. She counted the pods. “There were a total of  pods and you divided them into  parts. That’s  each.”“Now, if I divide  pods into  equal parts, I’ll get  in each. Look,” said Diya as she moved the pods into  groups. “So  divided by  is equal to .” “That’s not difficult,” said Pa. “No Pa, it’s not difficult. Remember when Ramu Kaka and you brought back our share of the rice from the farm?” asked Diya.“We divided the sacks, and each of us got  sacks,” said Pa. “Correct. There were  sacks in all for  families.  divided by  is equal to . And we had  sack left, which we poured equal portions of into  vessels,” said Diya.“So, division is like sharing something?” asked Pa. “Yes! Division is exactly that. We can even share time. In the morning, we have  minutes to use the bathroom.  minutes divided by  is  minutes. So you, Ma and I each gets  minutes. ”“But you take much more than  minutes, and I have to manage with lesser,” frowned Pa. Diya smiled. “Maybe you’re right. But in maths, division is sharing equally.”“We can divide work too. If we have to cook  dishes for dinner, each of us can cook  dish,” said Diya confidently. Diya saw Pa’s face light up. She felt like she had won a battle.“But today I will cook all  dishes,” said Pa, with a mischievous grin. He was hoping to escape the maths exercises that were sure to follow! Diya laughed. “But I want to cook too! What if we divide the work between us?” “So I’ll cook one dish and you cook the other. For the third one, we can divide the work between us. Correct, teacher?” asked Pa. “Correct, student,” replied Diya.Did You Know? The ancient Egyptians knew how to divide, and are likely to have used division in the planning and construction of the pyramids. However, they didn’t use the symbol that we use, which is called the obelus (÷). The first use of the obelus as a symbol for division was first seen in a book called ‘Teutsche Algebra’ by Johann Rahn published in the year .The Chinese used their own version of the abacus called the suanpan (or calculating pan) to do division, until calculators became widely available. Scientists say that we end up doing maths tasks like division while learning how to play musical instruments such as the guitar or the violin.	./Story text files/60.txt	3172	14	5.713864306784661	269	70	146	40.75	55	21	29	8.802631578947368	44	32	164	175	5	1.2887323943661972	371	55
Phani is always late. Or not where he is supposed to be. “Why does your teacher say you’re always late for school, Phani?” asks his father. “You leave home quite early.” “I can’t help it, Baba,” Phani says.His mother wants to know why he is sitting in front of the TV every evening instead of playing with the other children. “I can’t help it, Ma,” says Phani.Why not, his parents want to know. So do his teachers, friends and his sister, who had once asked him to post a letter.“Why can’t you help it, Phani?” they ask. “It’s because of my chappals,” Phani mumbles.“Speak up, child! Stand up straight, shoulders back!” That was his class teacher.So Phani explains. Every time he is on his way to school, his chappals know a better way to get there. Sometimes, they lead by the mango tree where there are lovely green mangoes.Sometimes, when his feet are sweating all over the chappals, they take him to school by a road that just happens to be near a clear, cool pond.And the chappals prefer to watch TV than be hurled at a pile of seven stones. Anybody should know that! “Next time your chappals don’t feel like posting a letter, at least let me know!” says Phani’s sister angrily.Nobody believes Phani. Today, Phani's mother has something for him. Phani is very happy.He opens the box and takes out a new pair of chappals!His mother is smiling. . .But Phani doesn't look very happy. I wonder why!	./Story text files/111.txt	1399	18	5.723684210526316	126	26	142	40.1764705882353	25	9	28	8.352941176470589	24	10	99	53	4	1.3815028901734103	161	12
"Arya always wanted to fly.When she was four years old, she wanted to be Rosamma. Arya saw her at the circus. Rosamma was a trapeze artist. Arya wanted to fly in the air from swing to swing. Her clothes would glitter like Rosamma’s. Hundreds of people would clap for her. She would eat cotton candy every day. Her best friend would be a clown.Trapeze artists climb a tall ladder, stand on a narrow board, hold the fly bar, and swing! Another trapeze artist is usually waiting to catch them on the other side.When Arya was eight years old she wanted to be Kalpana Chawla. She made herself an orange space suit. She wore it day and night. ""Arya, aren’t you feeling hot in that suit? "" ""Astronauts have to get used to the suit, Amma. Space is not as safe as Earth is. My suit will protect me. ""Kalpana Chawla grew up in Haryana, India. As an astronaut, Kalpana flew around the earth  times! Kalpana died doing her job when the spacecraft she was inside broke apart while returning to Earth.When Arya was twelve years old, she wanted to be Amelia Earhart. She built a model plane for her school project. It couldn’t fly, but she still got the second prize. Arya even got a haircut like Amelia!Amelia was the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean alone. Amelia’s dream was to fly around the world along the equator. She took off on her dream flight but went missing somewhere above the Pacific.Soon, Arya heard of Angulia Bai, Kumudammal and Sarla Thakral, the first Indian women to fly a plane. Angulia Bai was just sixteen years old! ""I can’t wait till I’m a teenager! "" ""So you can drive? "" ""No. "" ""So you can vote? "" ""No. "" ""Then what? "" ""So I can fly. ""On  May, , nineteenyearold Kummudammal and sixteenyearold Angulia Bai became the first women to obtain the ‘A’ pilot licence in India. They trained at the Madras Flying Club.When Arya was eighteen years old, she wanted to become a fighter pilot. ""Who are they, Chechi? "" asked her little brother Raju, seeing a poster on her wall. ""They are Bhawana, Avani and Mohana, the first women to fly fighter planes in India. "" ""Are they your friends? "" Arya laughed. ""Maybe some day, Raju…""Mohana, Bhawana and Avani are fighter pilots. Before them, only men were allowed to become fighter pilots in India. They protect the country’s borders from high up in the air. During disasters like floods and earthquakes, they take part in rescue missions.Arya saved up money to attend flying school. She spent years studying. She sat along with pilots to learn from them. She worked hard and ate a lot of carrots! Amma always said carrots are great for the eyes.Finally, she is ready to sit at the cockpit herself. Today is a special day for Arya. That’s her in the cockpit.

FAIRY CIRCLES  a true fairy tale This book belongs t: _________________________________On the South West coast of Africa there is a magical place called Namibia. My family and I are travelling there for our vacation. Namibia is like a land that time has forgotten. The land has been untouched for so long, many people believe it has turned magical. PAGE For example, the Welwitschia, is like a living fossil –A plant that may have been alive for over a  years! Yet only has two leaves. . . . . That's kind of magical. PAGE Or the wonderful colours of the desert, which change with the changing light of the day. Some of the highest dunes in the world are there. The desert itself is one of the oldest, which is why it is such a deep red in places. PAGE There are the Tsaris mountains, that seem to show the many layers of the earth's crust. There is a place where the Swakop River carved spectacular moonscapes in the granite rock around  million years ago. PAGE And then, there are the FAIRY CIRCLES. They dot the Namib Desert like a spotted handkerchief. PAGE Scientists think these circles may be created by termites, . . . or perhaps by fungi. (a fungi is a little bit like a mushroom, or, that is to say a mushroom is a type of fungi) But they don't know for sure. PAGE I think they are created by fairies. After all, why else would they be called “Fairy Circles?” PAGE Fairy Circles only occur in the Namib Desert, in the west of Namibia, on the edge of the escarpment where the desert's rain fall is highest. Perhaps this is because the fairies choose to only hold their magical fairy conferences in the Namib Desert, since it is such a special magical place. Or perhaps it is because there are lots of big open spaces with very few people, or even animals, in the Namib Desert. PAGE Do you think they dance in the day or night? I bet they choose to dance on the plains of the desert in the small hours of the morning. Or perhaps they dance during the day time when no one is looking. Wherever and whenever they dance, they leave the perfectly formed fairy circles. Where nothing grows inside, only around the edge. PAGE Fairy Circles come in lots of different sizes. Most are a few metres wide. Some are very big, big enough to hold a small herd of goats or calves; Others are very small, so small you can hardly see them. Fairy Circles may be less than  metre, up to as big as  metres wide! PAGE Perhaps the big ones are made by big fairies, and the small ones are made by small fairies. Perhaps the big giant ones, like this one, are made by a Giant Queen Mother fairy, who is the biggest fairy of them all. Perhaps she has many minion fairies with her to help with the dances. PAGE The first ever symposium about Fairy Circles was held in . (A symposium is a big meeting where lots of experts get together). They held it in the Namib Desert – of course! I bet they had lots of fun and learnt a lot. …. But. . . . they all agreed, they are still not sure what causes Fairy Circles. PAGE When we get to see the Namib Desert, I want to ask Mum and Dad if I can get up really early; To see if I can catch a glimpse of the fairies dancing. PAGE What do you think causes Fairy Circles? I still think it is fairies, and I really hope I will see some, so then I can tell you for sure. PAGE With or without the fairies help, if we all do our part to help look after the environment, the fairy circles will be around for a long time, for all of us to enjoy!

Thanks to The Namibian, for a quote from their article on Fairy Circles http://www. namibian. com. na/index. php? id=&page=archiveread Danielle BruckertFUN FACTS Fairy Circles Fairy Circles are mysterious in nature and appearance. No one knows what causes Fairy Circles, although there has been a lot of research completed on the topic by scientists. The most common theories are: ●sand termites; ●algae or fungi beneath the surface; ●residual plant toxins (residual poisons remaining after the death of certain plants); ●competing vegetation ecosystems; ●fairies (or perhaps dragons, or gods, but mostly fairies;). Fairy Circles occur only in the Namib Desert. They are mainly found on the eastern border where the rain fall is highest. Fairy Circles range from around  metre up to  metres. Really big Fairy Circles are sometimes used by local tribes as a kraal for livestock. Albi Bruckner, NamibRand founder, comments“I'm glad they didn't fnd the cause, as it makes such a great story.” “It is great that there is something out there that can't be explained by scientists. We need mysteries in life and be able to marvel and revere Nature in wonder and awe!” adds Nils, the organiser of the  symposium. We agree! There are not many magical things left in this world, this is one of them, it deserves a story.Namibia Namibia lies on Africa's West Coast. It is bordered on the East by the Kalahari Desert, and in the West by the Namib Desert and the Atlantic Coastline. The only permanent rivers in the country form the Northern and Southern borders. Its neighbouring countries are Angola, Botswana, and South Africa. The tip of the Caprivi Strip extends towards Victoria falls, where four countries, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Namibia meet. Namibia is one of the least populated countries in the world. At the time of writing it is second only to Mongolia. There are approximately .  million people in ,  square km. The offcial language is English, but there are twelve different languages spoken in Namibia, including nine tribal languages. The Damara and Nama languages utilise 'clicks' similar to that of the Kalahari bushmen. There are many amazing natural wonders within the country:  The Fish River Canyon is the largest canyon in Africa, and takes fve days to walk through.  The Ovahimba tribe in the North, despite being one of the wealthiest tribes in the country, still live the same way they have for hundreds of years.  The Welwitschia plant is called a 'living fossil', as some plants have been alive for over  years.  The Skeleton Coast is famous for its large number of ship wrecks, victims of the coastal fog and unforgiving waters of the Atlantic Ocean.  The quaint and picturesque coastal town of Swakopmund provides details of Namibia's German colonial heritage, and lots of fun for tourists.The Namib Desert The Namib Desert is where Namibia derives its name from. It stretches the length of Namibia's West coast, and includes the infamous stretch of coastline known as the Skeleton Coast. It spreads inland from the coast up to the sharp rise of the escarpment, with the Tsaris and Naukluft mountains prominent border features. The Namib is one of the most diverse deserts in the world, and may be one of the oldest. It has one of the largest number of endemic species of any desert in the world. With the annual rainfall between mm and mm, depending on the area, it is Southern Africa's only true desert. An increase in ecotourism has seen many livestock farms in the Namib converted into wildlife sanctuaries, allowing the endemic species to thrive. Animals found in the Namib include the majestic oryx (or gamsbok), Namibia's national animal, large numbers of fur seal, the endangered desert rhino and desert elephant, and many more. The Namib hosts some of the highest permanent dunes in the world. Dune  is approximately ft high. The stunning Sossusvlei Valley provides opportunity to climb some of these dunes, with Big Daddy being the most popular for ascent, and a very close second in height to Dune  at approximately ft. .QUESTIONS What causes Fairy Circles?

Apply to join one of the young researcher's camps in the Namib Desert. When travelling to Namibia: . Create a travel journal when you are visiting the Namib Desert, including pictures and interesting information about where you have been. . Collect some samples of rock, sand, plants, feathers, and other items that can be found in the desert (ensure not to disturb the natural habitat).Adopt a Fairy Circle of Your Own! Help the Namib Rand Conservation Foundation, and fairy circles everywhere! If you love the concept of fairy circles, for a very modest sum of ZAR you can adopt your very own Fairy Circle, to help protect the desert and the fairy circles for future generations to come.

People always ask her how she could leave NZ (a country some call God Zone), hopefully this book will help explain. She spent many years fying over the beautiful Namib Desert, as a charter pilot, and when asked about the strange dotted landscape she loved explaining to passengers “Why else would they have such a name, they're made by fairies, of course,” With a passion for children's books, and a desire to promote literacy, Danielle created the website 'Free Kids Books' to share free children's books and literacy material, where many of her own books can be found.

"Here is a feather and here is a stone. Which is heavy and which is light? What a silly question, you say. The stone is heavy and the feather is light, of course!Here is an elephant and here is the same stone. Which is heavy and which is light? What an absurd question, you say. The elephant is heavy and the stone is light, of course!Wait, didn’t you just say that the stone was heavy? Yes, that was because it was heavier than the feather! But it is MUCH lighter than an elephant.So maybe it is best not to say, “This is heavy,” or “This is light.” Maybe it is better to ask: Is this heaviER than something else? Is this lightER than something else?But what about the question  How heavy is this stone? Can we find the answer without talking about elephants or feathers? Yes, we can! We can compare the weight of the stone to something called a kilogram*. A kilogram is used to find out how heavy or light a thing is. A good question to ask then is  How much heavier than a kilogram is the stone? Or How much lighter than a kilogram is our stone? *A ‘kilogram’ is the same thing as ‘kilo’ or ‘kg’. From now on, let’s say kg when we mean kilogram – it’s shorter.But how heavy is a kg? Let's see. You tell the vegetable vendor at the market, “Please give me  kg of onions. "" The vendor puts a kg weight on one side of the scale and piles onions on the other side until the two sides are level. You count the onions on the scale. There are  onions. That tells you that  kg is as heavy as  onions. But this is not entirely reliable. When the onions are small,  kg may be as heavy as  onions. When they are big,  kg may be only as heavy as  onions.We need to find something that weighs EXACTLY  kg. I know! A litre bottle of water weighs exactly  kg. Now that we know this, let’s get back to our elephant. How heavy is an elephant in kgs? Around ,  kg! So if you could get an elephant to sit on one side of a pair of scales, you would need a whopping ,  litre water bottles to balance its weight.,  kg is also the weight of  cows, or  mediumsized dogs.Now that we have talked about some Very Heavy things, let us ask a bolder question  How heavy is the Earth? The Earth, including all the creatures in it, weighs . . .. . . , , , , , , , ,  kgs! Or as much as , , , , , , , ,  litre water bottles! That is very, VERY heavy! Even if we used all the water on earth, there would not be enough to fill them all.Uff. This conversation is getting too heavy. Let us bring the feather back. How light is a feather? It is roughly , ,  times lighter than a kg. If you put a litre water bottle on one side of a scale, you would have to put about , ,  feathers on the other side to make the two sides balance.A raindrop is about ,  times lighter than a kg. Roughly ,  raindrops will weigh as much as a litre bottle of water. A grain of salt is about , , ,  (two crore) times lighter than a kg. That is very, VERY light!Phew! You must be feeling quite lightheaded now. And your brain must be buzzing with questions. Questions like: How do we weigh a grain of sand? How on earth did people weigh the Earth? Who decided the weight of  kg? Bet you can’t wait to find the answers when you grow up!Guesstimate It Perfect for both classroom and home, this activity will help children get a feel for weight estimation. You will need:  A pair of scales with two pans and weights*  A litre bottle filled with water  Objects of different weights found in school or at home  a small bag of vegetables, a book, a duster, a packet of rice, and so on. What to do: . Pass the bottle of water around the class asking each child to feel its weight. This gives them a sense of how heavy a kg is. . Pass the other objects around one by one, asking each child if the object feels heavier or lighter than  kg. Also ask each to guess the actual weight of each object and write it on the board. . Weigh each object on the scales, first against the litre bottle (to answer the question 'Is it heavier or lighter than  kg? ') and then against the actual weights, to see how good each child's guesstimate was. *If it is difficult to find a pair of scales, invite the local vegetable vendor to your classroom (with his scales! ). In Step  above, pass bags of vegetables (of different weights) around.Think About It . On page , you found out that a litre bottle of water weighs exactly  kg. How many water bottles would add up to YOUR weight? . You now know that an averagesized Indian elephant weighs about ,  kgs. If we told you that a train loaded with passengers weighs the same as  elephants, can you find out how many kgs it weighs? . Which is heavier– kg of iron or  kg of cotton wool?Answers: . , ,  (ten lakh) kgs ( x  = , , ) . They are both EQUALLY heavy because both weigh the same– kg! But  kg of cotton wool would take up a LOT more space than  kg of iron."	./Story text files/67.txt	4825	14	5.120622568093385	440	74	225	49.270833333333336	52	44	49	11.333333333333334	37	59	313	201	6	1.1905511811023621	591	44

Una, the mountain goat, lived in Sakuland. Sakuland was a wonderful country. It stretched from the shores of the sea to the forests, from the valleys to the mountain.The animals loved Sakuland. There was grass for the rabbits and the deer, insects for the birds and the bears to snack on, and fish for the crocodiles and wild cats. There was clear, cool water for everyone.Una lived high above the others, on top of a mountain. The climb up and down the rocky mountain trails was long and difficult. She didn’t spend too much time with the other animals, and got used to being alone. She rather liked it – she could do whatever she wanted, whenever she wanted. Sometimes Una thought that the others were a bit silly. Why do they always have to do everything together? Can’t they go to the stream by themselves? I do, thought Una. All the animals had ways they liked to do things. But Una thought her ways were the best.Slowly, Sakuland’s climate began to change, but the animals weren’t really paying attention. One day, the whales who spent most of the year in Sakuland’s waters announced that they were going to live someplace else.“Why?” asked the turtles. “It’s quite nice here.” “The water has become a bit too warm for us,” said the whales. “We will have to go further north where it’s cooler.” The whales liked to live in cool waters and Sakuland’s water was now too warm.The turtles would miss the beautiful songs sung by the whales. But they didn’t think too much about it. At least I’m okay, the turtles thought. “Picky, picky,” muttered Una to herself. “I don’t mind if it’s too hot or cold! They should be more like me.” Everyone soon forgot about the whales. But one day, the turtles started to pack up and leave. “Why?” asked the wild cats. “You always seemed happy here.” “There’s hardly enough sand left for us,” said the turtles, who laid their eggs on the sandy beach. “Where did it go?” asked the wild cats. “All we know is that the sand used to reach to the big rock,” said the big, old turtle. “But the big rock doesn’t look so big now – the water has almost covered it.” Too bad for the turtles. But at least I’m okay, thought the wild cats.Una saw the turtles leave and thought, What difference does it make to me if the sand disappears under water? The turtles should have been smart like me when deciding where to live. Una went looking for some grass to snack on and forgot about the whole matter.Then the wild cats left. They couldn’t catch nice fish anymore in the stream. It had become just a trickle. The deer thought, Oh, how terrible for the wild cats. But at least I’m okay. Una looked over at the stream where she drank. “The wild cats are pretty tough, but they must not be as tough as me.”One day, Una noticed something strange. Every year, the snow on her mountain would melt, just like an ice cube, and fill up her stream. But now there was less snow. Una wasn’t quite certain and thought, Maybe it just looks that way today.But then strange animals began to come to Sakuland. Everyone tried to be friendly to the cows. But the newcomers didn’t take much notice – they kept munching the grass and chewing it and chewing it some more. And there were so many of them!The deer were not too happy when the grass began to disappear. Slowly, the deer had to go outside Sakuland to find enough of the grass they liked. Hmmm. . . they should see what I have to eat at times, thought Una. Sometimes I have to lick the lichens on rocks. Not pleasant at all. Una stayed on her mountain as long as she could, but she often found herself, without enough to eat or drink.Finally, hungry and thirsty, Una climbed down the difficult mountain path. She tasted some of the grass from the hills, but it wasn’t the kind she liked. She found a stream in a valley, but the water’s taste was not as crisp as she was used to. Now Una realised why the other animals had left – it’s very important to eat the food that suits you best and have water nearby.The animals she knew had left Sakuland when they couldn’t find their favourite food easily, or when they were too thirsty because the stream had slowed down to a muddy trickle, or when their home trees were cut down to build homes for others. Una and her friends thought at least it’s not me when changes affected someone else. As the oceans became warmer, the whales left in search for a more suitable home. The turtles, the deer, and Una couldn’t care less. But later, they had to admit now it IS me. Una had to admit that having friends nearby is a necessity. She was determined to go find the others.At least it’s not me Una and her friends who live in Sakuland are facing climate change, just like we are. Human beings are burning more and more Green Houses Gases (GHG) – there’s carbon dioxide from coal and oil. Carbon dioxide is also released when we cut trees, then methane which cows that live in farms burp out, and nitrous oxides from cars and other vehicles. These Green House Gases are added to the atmosphere and that is causing global warming and changing the climate. As more heat is trapped in the atmosphere by the GHGs, the ice in the poles is melting and sea levels are rising. All of that means that the weather is becoming more unpredictable – it’s cold in the summer and warm in the winter, and the rains don’t come on time, like they used to. And that is climate change.Because of Climate Change… When forests are cut down, they add to the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere. Animals also lose their homes, the forest, and they have to go to faroff places in search of food. Farmers are not able to grow their crops properly because of erratic rainfall. Often, they sow the seeds but there’s no rain, and their crops fail. Imagine a world without mango or chocolate because there was no rain or too much rain and the crop failed! Unpredictable weather also affects human beings. For example, during storms, floods, or droughts, people lose their homes. The pollution in the atmosphere affects our health and we fall ill more often. Climate change affects humans, earth, and all its creatures.	./Story text files/141.txt	6089	14	5.683087027914614	504	105	241	61.78350515463917	42	55	44	12.474226804123711	31	66	382	227	4	1.4252199413489737	611	71
Kallu stood frowning up at a huge poster stuck on the wall of the school compound. “Madan Murari Dev Maharaj is here!” he read out aloud. “Astrologer, master of horoscopes, tantra expert…” He turned to his best friend Damu who was standing beside him and asked, “What’s a kundalini?”“I’m not too sure…” Damu scratched his ear, “something that goes up and down the spine…” “And what does that do?” “Generates some sort of electricity.” “Kya baat! He could solve our powercut problem then,” Kallu grinned. “Right! We’ll all use the kundalini to start the water pump in the fields,” Damu laughed. By then, they had been joined by Kallu’s younger brother Shabbo. “Madan Murari Dev Maharaj,” he read the big letters under the picture of a fat man with a beard and a bright red turban. “Long name!” “Of course he has a long name,” Damu replied. “Look at all the things he can do – astrology, horoscopes, numbers, face reading, palmistry…”As they walked away, Shabbo who had got four out of ten in the last maths test, asked thoughtfully, “Do you think he could predict the questions in tomorrow’s class test?”Soon the news of the astrologer had spread across Khajuria village. According to Damu’s grandmother Moti Dadi, Murari Dev had to just look into your eyes and say a mantra and he instantly knew everything about you – your past, present, future were all transferred to his mind like magic.“You mean now he knows that you borrowed a shawl from Billo Chachi and never returned it?” Damu’s sister Saru asked with a grin. “Don’t be silly, that is not important!” Moti Dadi waved a dismissive hand. “It is important to Billo Chachi,” Saru’s friend Munia commented and that made Moti Dadi so angry that she shooed both the girls out of her room. So Kallu and his gang decided it was time to check out ‘Madan Murari Dev Maharaj, World Renowned Astrologer– Palmist–Tantra Expert–Futurologist– Numerologist. ’ The gang included Kallu and Damu who were both in class nine.Saru and Munia were in class eight and Shabbo who was the youngest was in the seventh. In the school register, Kallu was Kallan, Damu was Damodar, Munia was Munira, Saru was Saraswati and Shabbo was Shabbir, but even their school principal, Masterji often forgot their real names.The gang headed out the same evening. The astrologer was a guest at the home of Raghu Singh, the village sarpanch, and on the way to his house, they had to go past the Hanuman temple and there they saw a very strange sight. The temple priest Lattu Mishra was sitting hunched up outside, his chin resting on his knees, looking sadly out into space. Lattu was usually a cheerful man who greeted people with a smile. Masterji had chosen him to play Bharat in the village Ramleela because of his kind face and gentle smile. “Lattu Bhaiya,” Munia ran up and asked anxiously, “what’s the matter? Are you ill?” Lattu shook his head gloomily and then nodded to the temple behind him, “See the temple? It’s Tuesday and it is empty.”They looked at the deserted temple in surprise. Usually on Tuesdays, people would stream in all day. It would echo with the chanting of mantras and the ringing of bells and Lattu would be busy before the altar, doing puja and arti to Hanumanji. “To Raghu Singh’s house, where else? Since the day that astrologer fellow has started his business, no one has time for Hanumanji anymore.” “Have you seen him?” “Of course I have! I know everything about him. He used to have a mithai shop in town at one time and his name was Murari Lal. Everyone called him Mota Murari because he was so fat. Then suddenly he grew a beard and became this MadanwhateverMaharaj. He’s just learnt some magic tricks and is fooling the whole village.”“I’d read in the papers,” Kallan said thoughtfully, “about this school for magicians in Kerala. The principal of the school said that half his students were fake astrologers and sadhus.” “Maybe he went there.” Then Lattu noticed that they were all wearing their good clothes and looking very neat and clean. “You all are also going there?” he asked sadly. “Just for a look, Lattu Bhaiya,” Saru said gently. “We’ll be back soon.” When they strolled up to Raghu Singh’s house, they discovered that a huge tent had been put up in front and behind it, a smaller tent that had a kitchen where two cooks were busy over a large karhai that was smoking over a fire. Damu zipped off for a quick look and came back with a happy gleam in his eyes.Peering in, they discovered that the main tent was packed with people. They squeezed in at the back and looked around; it looked like the whole village was present.There was Dharampal Chacha, the chai shop owner who played Ram in the Ramleela and his pretty wife Billo Chachi. Kishan Prasad, the grocer was chatting with Masterji who was offering him a paan. Even Mangu Mali, the mango orchard owner was sitting in a corner giving everyone his sour smile. Badri, the mad buffalo man who was sitting right in front of them turned, gave a grin — his huge yellow teeth gleaming behind his bushy moustache  and asked, “Did you check the kitchen at the back?”“Of course I did,” Damu gave a superior smile. He never missed out on important matters like food. “They are making halwa and puri, with asli ghee!” “Aha ha ha!” Badri rolled his eyes in ecstasy.“Raghu Singh is a fool,” Mangu Mali said grimly, “feeding everyone and wasting money like this.” A sort of stage had been built in front with folding tables. A very tall, thin man was busy covering it with a mattress and a white sheet and then he placed a couple of bolsters on top. He lit a bunch of incense sticks and waved them about in the air.“Who’s that?” Munia wanted to know. “That is Paltan Pandey,” Shabbo said, as the thin man began fixing a mike. “I asked him and he told me that he was the Maharaj’s number one assistant.” “Where is number two?” Kallu looked around. “I don’t think there is one,” Damu laughed. Kallu wondered if people planned to spend their hard earned money to get their horoscopes read or, like his gang, were only there for the ‘asligheehalwapuri prasad’ treat.Madan Murari Dev Maharaj was late and everyone was getting restless. Heads kept turning to the opening in the tent to see if he was coming. A couple of babies began to bawl, then Moti Dadi had a coughing fit and Saru had to go out and get her a glass of water.Billo Chachi had come prepared to wait and had nearly finished knitting the sleeve of a sweater. Noticing the growing restlessness, Paltan Pandey suddenly sat down with a harmonium and began to sing a bhajan in a flat, tuneless moan. Everyone was falling into a bored trance when to their surprise, Paltan suddenly shot up his arms in the air and yelled “Jai Murari Dev!” making everyone jump.It seemed the audience was expected to join in and they did. At least it was something to do. So everyone waved their arms and echoed his call, “Jai Murari Dev!” The gang grinned at each other and joined in, yelling at the top of their voices, “Jai Kapil Dev! Jai Kapil Dev!” but after they had called for their cricket hero Kapil the third time, some of the elders turned and glared at them and they decided to shut up. Too much of the funny stuff could get them kicked out of the tent and as Damu pointed out, halwapuri was at stake. As if finally hearing their calls, Murari Dev arrived, leaning on the arm of Raghu Singh and walking very, very slowly. “Baap re!” an astonished Saru whispered. “He’s really fat!” “That photo on the poster must have been taken years ago.”Murari Dev was quite short and wearing a bright red flowing silk robe, and rows and rows of multicoloured beads were hanging around his neck. His long, grey beard flowed down over his generous potbelly and he was quite bald. There was a red tikka drawn on his forehead and even though it was evening, to everyone’s surprise he wore a jazzy pair of dark glasses.“Dark glasses?” Damu looked around, “where’s the sun?” Murari Dev went past them and they were swept away by the strong scent of his cologne. “Kya baat!” Kallu commented happily. “Dark glasses, bead necklaces, perfume, this is a hero horoscope man! Straight from Bollywood!” Munia was still staring at Paltan with a thoughtful frown, “Paltan looks familiar somehow.” “I know,” Shabbo grinned, “in a safari suit, he’d look just like Ram Lochan at the petrol pump.” “Correct!” they all said together. Badri turned to glare at them, “Chup!” So they shut up but Munia and Saru had to try really hard to stop the giggles. They never knew astrology could be so funny! By then Murari Dev was sitting leaning against a bolster, panting slightly and wiping his face with a handkerchief.Paltan rushed up with a glass of water. Raghu Singh switched on a table fan. Murari Dev cleared his throat, checked his watch and pulled the mike closer. “Please start,” Damu muttered, “the halwa is getting cold.” With majestic slowness, Murari Dev stood up, walked to the edge of the stage and with a dramatic flourish, waved his podgy hands in the air.Suddenly walnuts and raisins were raining on the audience! Behind the astrologer, Paltan was banging away at the harmonium and swaying to the tune. Murari Dev waved his arms again and more raisins and walnuts flew around.“They’re real!” Saru mumbled, busy chewing. “Must have got them from Kishen Prasad’s grocery store,” Damu said as he scrambled about for more. The gang sat up. It looked like the introduction was over and the show was about to begin. Paltan announced on the mike that Murari Dev would now predict the future and read minds. He then walked around in the audience with chits of paper. Someone would write a number on a chit, which would be sealed inside an envelope and carried to the astrologer, who would touch the envelope, hum a mantra and then recite the number correctly.Very impressed by the mind reading, people were soon trooping up on stage to know about their futures and many of them were carrying their horoscopes. Murari Dev talked to them in a low voice and then whispered his predictions into their ears. So the gang could not hear anything . The rupee notes were soon piling up in the brass plate kept before him. Finally the show was over and everyone got their leaf plate of halwapuri. To the background music of the harmonium, Murari Dev got up and swayed across the stage. Then with a piercing yell and a splintering crash, Murari Dev vanished!There was pandemonium in the pandal. Paltan and Raghu Singh were frantically searching for him. Moti Dadi was weeping loudly and calling out, “Maharaj aap kahan ho?” Masterji was yelling at the gang, ordering them to go and find a torch. And in the middle of all the chaos, Badri and Mangu Mali stood there, laughing their heads off.Then to everyone’s relief, Murari Dev slowly crawled out from under the stage and as Paltan and Raghu Singh rushed up to help him, he stood up groggily. He was quite a sight, his snazzy glasses askew, his beard covered in spider’s web and his silk robe all dusty. “What happened?” Damu asked puzzled. “I thought it was a vanishing act,” Kallu said. It took a while to solve the mystery. The stage had been made with three wooden folding tables and one of them had a broken leg. When fat Murari Dev had stepped on it, the table had collapsed taking him down with it. He now sat panting on a chair, flushed, dishevelled and obviously feeling very sorry for himself.At this crucial moment, Saru spoke up. Planting herself in front of the astrologer, she bent a stern face towards him and said clearly above the hubbub, “But Murari Devji. . . I don’t understand this!” The fat astrologer sat up and stared at her. “You could read the numbers, pick walnuts out of the air and predict futures. How is it that you didn’t know that the table was broken?” In the growing silence, Murari Dev glared at Saru and her gang who were standing there looking critically at him. Then with a grim look on his face, he got up and stalked out of the pandal, as everyone began to laugh. Moti Dadi laughed so hard that she had another coughing fit and everyone agreed it had been a really great show.	./Story text files/323.txt	12084	21	5.923076923076923	996	252	263	71.8012048192771	63	103	46	13.94578313253012	54	112	619	629	8	1.609261939218524	1183	199

"""Please Ma, may I help you make scarecrows? "" asked Gauri. Ma was tying some sticks together to make a scarecrow. She put an old shirt over the sticks, and then stuffed it with hay.Gauri walked to the clothesline where the washed clothes were drying. She picked up a dress. ""I will dress her up in my new red frock and tie her hair with red ribbons too! She will look so lovely! ""“You silly girl. You can’t have a pretty scarecrow. Scarecrows have to scare the birds away, and so they must look scary! Like this!” said Mother, making a face and waving her arms. Gauri giggled. “You look so funny Ma!”Mother took the scarecrows into the fields and fixed them amidst the tall stalks of grain. ""There now, be good scarecrows and chase the birds away, "" said Gauri, patting them.Gauri and her mother returned to their hut. Gauri went inside and lay on her cot. A big yellow moon was rising, bathing the field in a soft, white glow.Gauri saw a scarecrow look down at its clothes. “Why do we always have to wear these tattered old clothes?” said a scarecrow with a sigh. “I wish we had something pretty to wear!” “Yes, me too!” said another. The scarecrows looked around the field. Suddenly, one of them called out, “Hey, look at those lovely clothes flapping in the breeze. Why don’t we wear those?” “Oooo! These clothes are so pretty. Let us try them on!” said another.One scarecrow tried on a lovely red dress with sequins on them. It sparkled in the moonlight. She tied the pretty red ribbons that were flapping in the breeze on her straw hair. Thrilled with her new clothes she began to show them off.Soon, all the scarecrows were busy dressing up! They began to parade. They walked! They turned! They twisted! They twirled! They tossed their empty mudpot heads, and smiled their crooked mudpot smiles. They were having a wonderful time!At the same time, hundreds of birds flew down to the fields. Birds here, birds there, birds everywhere. Beaks smacking! Beaks munching! Beaks chomping! ""Mmm! This is delicious! "" said one, as she wiped her beak with her wing.“It is not everyday that we can eat in the fields, without being shooed away by the scarecrows.” The scarecrows heard this and looked around. They were horrified! “Shoo! Be gone!” they shouted at the birds, waving their straw hands wildly, to and fro.Gauri screamed. Her mother came running. “Gauri, Gauri, what is the matter? Wake up!” “Oh Ma, the birds! They are eating up all the grain.” Her mother held her tight, and said, “Shh, my child! Look at the fields. They are safe! It must be a bad dream.”Gauri looked out. She saw the scarecrows, standing just where they were placed.Oh, wait a minute, were they waving to her? She looked closer. She saw a red ribbon fluttering on a scarecrow's hair. She blinked and looked again. Did the scarecrow just wink at her?"	./Story text files/544.txt	2826	12	5.86896551724138	233	57	94	35.714285714285715	57	20	19	7.51948051948052	51	26	167	123	4	1.3371428571428572	316	34
In a little hilly hamlet of southern India, lived a young girl called Bulbuli. She lived in a hut with her mother. Her house was surrounded by the tallest and greenest trees you would have ever seen. On misty days, the leaves of plants and trees held the biggest dewdrops you could imagine. Bulbuli was as sprightly as her name. She, along with her friends, would prance through the endless forests around her village. She loved to take in deep breaths every morning as the air carried all kinds of different aromas. Sometimes she could smell a sweet, sweet fragrance. At other times it was a strong and sharp scent. Then there were days when all she could smell was a familiar bouquet.Waking up to those refreshing scents was the best way for Bulbuli to begin her day. Then there was Totaram the parrot, who would fly in to the village every morning, perch himself atop a tree facing Bulbuli’s hut, and tell her of the entire buzz in the forest. He would also tell her of his flights to different lands and of people who lived there. Bulbuli loved to hear Totaram’s tales. She longed to visit these lands and see their different sights. Her heart would race and thump loudly as Totaram would speak but it would always end with a deep sigh. She had to stop dreaming of faraway lands when she had never even been to Senseless Point.Everybody in the village talked of Senseless Point. A few people from the neighbouring villages had been there but no one from her own village. From all the talk around, it seemed like a mysterious place promising an experience of a lifetime. Bulbuli believed that if she ever had the chance to go to Senseless Point, she would return to her hamlet and describe it to everyone. She would tell everyone about this mysterious place.On this particular morning, Bulbuli waited for Totaram’s whistle. She fed the hens and collected their eggs. Next she fed the cows and then milked them. All the while she paused from time to time to listen to Totaram’s call. Tired of waiting, she left for her school. All the students in her school sat under a huge banyan tree.Bulbuli could hardly pay attention to what was being taught. Her eyes searched for Totaram, who had never missed visiting her ever since the time they became friends. Several days passed and Bulbuli grew more concerned about Totaram. She worried that Totaram might be hurt. She had no way of knowing if he was safe. Bulbuli grew more despondent with each day. After school, she would walk through the forests calling out to Totaram. “Hello! Are you here somewhere Totaram?” she would yell cupping her mouth with her hands. But there was no response.Then one very early morning, even before the sun had risen, she heard a very noisy and distressed bird call. She leapt out of bed and rushed out to look. It was Totaram. “Bulbuli! Wake up! I need to talk to you!” Bulbuli stretched out her arm so that Totaram could perch on it. “Where have you been, Totaram? I have been so worried about you. What is the matter? You seem very upset!” “There is trouble at Senseless Point. War has broken out in the forest.” “Calm down Totaram or you will wake the entire village. What kind of trouble are you talking about? And who is at war?” asked a puzzled Bulbuli. “The jungle. . . Oops! Sorry, Bulbuli. I do need to stop screaming. The jungles are at war. Senseless Point is not what it used to be. All the animals are frightened. They do not know what is going to happen next. Bulbuli, we have to think of something,” cried Totaram anxiously. “I still do not understand. How can jungles be at war? Why don’t you take me to Senseless Point?” said Bulbuli.Totaram grew even more agitated. “Senseless Point is two sunrises and two dusks away. Your small feet will not be able to carry you there.” “My mind is bigger than my feet, Totaram. Don’t let the size of my feet fool you. I’m not afraid to do difficult things. Besides, the least I can do is try.” “The journey is long and hard, Bulbuli. I’m not sure…” mused Totaram. “Well, I cannot think of any other way to help. You must take me to Senseless Point,” pleaded Bulbuli. Totaram thought for a long time. Reluctantly, he agreed. “All right then, but we must leave immediately,” he said.Just then Bulbuli realised that she could not leave without telling her mother. Totaram suggested that they stop on the way to get Koyal, his friend to tell her mother first thing in the morning. “Hurry now. We must not lose any time,” Totaram urged. So off they went. Totaram flew just above Bulbuli’s head and led the way. Bulbuli walked and walked for several hours. She was not unused to walking through thickets and tall grass. But then she grew hungry and tired. Totaram could see that she needed to eat and drink. “Just a little longer Bulbuli. There are coconut trees up ahead,” said Totaram. When they reached the coconut plantations, Totaram let out a shrill whistle. “Whoeeeee…” From nowhere swung a frisky monkey. He was so full of beans that Totaram had to chide him. “Calm down, Bandaroo! I have work for you. Stop prancing around.”“Alright Totaram. What is it?” asked Bandaroo. “Pluck a couple of coconuts and toss them below. My friend Bulbuli here is hungry,” informed Totaram. Bandaroo obliged. He threw three green coconuts down. They split open as they crashed to the ground. Bulbuli hungrily reached out for them and scooped out the creamy kernel. She ate quickly when all the while Bandaroo squealed with delight from the tree above. “Thanks Bandaroo. That was filling,” said Bulbuli. “Call me anytime folks. I’m the best thrower in the jungle,” said Bandaroo chirpily.Totaram and Bulbuli carried on with their journey. After several hours, Bulbuli grew weary and exhausted. However, she was not going to give up. She had an opportunity of a lifetime here. A visit to Senseless Point for people around her village was like a pilgrimage. Each time that she felt fatigued, Bulbuli tried to picture Senseless Point in her mind. She imagined a beautiful place that could fill people’s hearts with happiness. That scene in her mind was enough to make her forget how footsore she was. The first dusk of their journey set in. ‘Another day to go, ’ thought Bulbuli. Bulbuli rested under a tree while Totaram found a comfortable spot on a branch above. Soon it was dawn. Bulbuli was awakened by the chattering of what seemed like a million birds in the jungle. Bulbuli took several big breaths and stretched her arms out to wake up her body. The morning felt different. She could smell all the familiar scents that she used to every morning, but somehow, they were stronger and more refreshing.“Totaram! Can you smell the freshness in the air? I love it!” she told the parrot. “You have all day to take your whiffs. Let us get moving,” ordered Totaram. Totaram and she talked little the next day. He could see that Bulbuli was tired, hungry and thirsty. Totaram flew down to perch on her shoulder. “There is a stream nearby. We will rest there for a while.” In a little while, Bulbuli heard the sound of rushing water. In no time they arrived at the stream. The clear water glistened in the sunlight. The water seemed to be racing with itself to get somewhere. It was a beautiful sight. Bulbuli leaned over and cupped the water in her hands and drank all that she could. She splashed water on her face and refreshed herself. Just as she was done, Totaram landed on her shoulder once again and nudged her to stretch out her palms. He then dropped red, delicious berries in them.“Oh Totaram! You are the nicest friend I know. Thank you so much,” smiled Bulbuli. “Go ahead and eat them. Berries are my favourite food. I have already eaten too many today!” gushed Totaram. They rested for a while and then set out once again. Bulbuli walked and walked while Totaram flew just above her talking to her all the while. After several hours, Bulbuli sat down. “I need to rest Totaram. I am really very exhausted. Totaram let out a loud whistle. Within minutes, an elephant strolled up to them. Totaram introduced Hathi to Bulbuli and told him of their journey to Senseless Point. “I believe only a human can help the war in the jungle. Animals are running away from what is paradise for us,” said a concerned Hathi. “Will you give Bulbuli a ride, Hathi?” asked Totaram. “Her will is strong but her strength is failing.”“Of course. Climb up, little girl, but I can only take you up to the trail. After that you are on your own. I cannot be away from my group for long,” said Hathi. Bulbuli was relieved. Her small legs needed rest and she was able to get a spectacular view of the jungle from atop Hathi’s back. Hathi, like Totaram, had many tales to tell. The day passed easily. At dusk, the trio settled by a cave. Totaram and Hathi gathered dried leaves and straw and made a bed for Bulbuli. As soon as Bulbuli lay down, she dozed off. At the third sunrise, Totaram did not have to wake Bulbuli. She was up at the crack of dawn. Totaram brought her some purple berries this time, which she ate with delight. The young girl, the parrot and the elephant began the last leg of their journey. Bulbuli was becoming more uncertain of what to expect. First there was the anticipation of Senseless Point. Then there was the uneasiness of the jungles at war. As she was getting closer to her destination, her heart began to fill with thrill and excitement but with a tinge of apprehension.Shortly, Hathi stopped. He said, “It is time for me to say goodbye. I must return to my family. All the animals will be grateful to you if you could help end the war of the jungles. We cannot bear to live anywhere else. These jungles have been our home for generations.” Bulbuli thanked Hathi for carrying her as far as he did. “I hope the jungles hear me out, Hathi. I promise to do my best.” Totaram sat on Bulbuli’s shoulder and asked her to slow down. “Look at that trail going downward. That will lead us to Senseless Point,” instructed Totaram. At this point, a strange humming sound enveloped the jungle. As they walked further, the noise grew louder and louder. “Where is that noise coming from?” asked Bulbuli covering her ears. “That is the sound of three jungles at war, and it is only going to get louder as we approach Senseless Point,” hollered Totaram.Bulbuli could barely believe what was going on. Never before had she encountered such a scene. As she climbed down the trail and looked around, she saw nothing out of the ordinary. But the clamour was ear splitting. Totaram pecked at her ear to get her attention. With the shrieks of the jungles, Bulbuli could hardly hear Totaram. With three more steps, Bulbuli found herself amidst a clearing. It was as if all the trees of the jungle had suddenly disappeared. There were hillocks stretching as far as her eyes could see. “This is Senseless Point. This is a place where everything grows wild. Humans hardly ever come here,” said Totaram. Then Totaram began screaming, “A human being is here, a human being!” But in the deafening din of the jungles, his voice went unheard. Bulbuli could not get herself to remove her hands from her ears. She could not understand what the jungles were saying, but by now it was clear that there were three jungles involved.In the distance, just in front of her, she could see green beds. On her right, were hundreds and hundreds of shrubs with magenta flowers. On her left, she could see very tall plants. The sight before her was breathtaking. And the aroma was stunning. Bulbuli’s face lit up with wonder. She turned towards each jungle several times over, to take in the splendour. Almost instantly, the noise of the jungles began to die down, as if the jungles had spotted her. That was when Bulbuli took her first deep breath. She could smell the aroma of tea. Then in the next breath, she was drawn to the fragrance on her right. It was a spicy fragrance something she was familiar with. Unsure, she breathed in some more and said to herself, “Ah! Elaichi!”A gentle breeze pushed her to her left. Her head turned and she smiled when she took in her next deep breath. It was an attractive and pure smell. Instantly, she recognised the plant. Bulbuli joined her hands and bowed with reverence. “You are Tulsi!” Bulbuli was overwhelmed by the fragrances. They smelled like three octaves of the same musical note – Sa, Sa, Sa. Bulbuli felt joyful. She stretched her arms and twirled around with her eyes closed.The fragrances and the musical notes played in her head, over and over again. All her senses were alive. This was a magical moment for her. Never before had she felt so delighted. Just then, the elaichi plant spoke, “Maybe this little girl could punish the tea bushes.” “Maybe. Little girl, can you stop the tea bushes from stealing our fragrance?” asked a Tulsi plant. Bulbuli was stunned to hear the jungles speak to her. Before she could respond, a tea bush spoke up. “Maybe if these two were not around, humans might be able to appreciate our aroma.”“Is that what this war is all about, worrying about your smells getting stolen?” asked a puzzled Bulbuli. She smiled to herself. “Do you have any idea what you all smell like from where I stand? I can smell each of you distinctly.” “It really is not our fault. We are not fragrance thieves. Our leaves take on the smell of anything that grows around us. In fact, with tulsi and elaichi around us, we have to work extra hard to keep our identity. It is not as if the tulsi jungle and the elaichi jungle have lost their perfume to me. You just said that you can smell their individual whiff,” said a tea bush. Bulbuli took several deep breaths to calm down. She discovered that every time she took in a collected breath of tea, elaichi and tulsi, it helped her relax. There was something very soothing about the three of them together.“My mother has taught me important things from the Vedas. Do you know what they have to say?” asked Bulbuli. “The sun should be a giver of happiness, the sky should be a giver of happiness, and all trees and plants should be givers of happiness. All these should give us peace of mind. Do you think you are doing that?” The jungles fell silent. They were listening to Bulbuli. Bulbuli had an idea. She whispered something to Totaram. He flew off from her shoulder almost immediately. A tulsi plant spoke. “The elaichi and tulsi grow wild. We have no control over where and how we grow. And neither do we tell the wind which way to blow.” Bulbuli thought for a moment. “In that case, how can you blame the tea? Maybe you ought to blame the wind.”“The wind! Tulsi and Elaichi fight constantly with the wind too. They do not want the wind to take their perfume out of here,” said a tea bush. Bulbuli was aghast. “Is that true?” she asked. Neither of the two guilty jungles replied. Bulbuli sighed deeply. Just then Totaram returned. He carried a few tulsi leaves, some elaichi seeds and tea leaves in his beak and placed them on Bulbuli’s palm. Bulbuli gently rubbed them together. She raised her palm to smell them. She let out a loud delighted shriek. The jungles screamed back in unison, “What is the matter, little girl? Are you all right?”Bulbuli laughed with joy. “You can now wave the white flag for peace. I have a bit of all three of you in my hand and together you smell like nothing else in the world. One whiff of all of you together is so relaxing.” Totatram whispered in Bulbuli’s ear. She smiled. “Totaram tells me that the animals in the jungles have known just which leaf to eat when they are unwell. Even the birds have eaten your fruit and leaves together to know how quickly you can make them better again. Did you jungles even know that?” asked Bulbuli. “These animals eat your leaves to relieve all kinds of sickness. They even come here to Senseless Point to rejuvenate themselves. Totaram, get me a bunch of tea, elaichi and tulsi. I am going back home to brew a warm cup of tea with tulsi and elaichi for my mother. Celebrate, jungles! The world is going to know how well you taste together. Which means that you have to get on well with each other. Can you do that?” asked Bulbuli.Bulbuli and Totaram giggled. So did the jungles. This time the noise level rose not because of the fighting, but with laughter. Bulbuli was relieved to see the war coming to an end. She realised that the jungles had each been able to feel pride in their uniqueness. Bulbuli asked Totaram to collect bunches of tea, tulsi leaves along with elaichi seeds. “Jungles, I am now going to return to my village with the most exquisite and refreshing tea, one with tulsi and elaichi. And I promise to return with people from my village to introduce them to Senseless Point. The most refreshing place on earth!” That is how tulsi and elaichi flavoured tea was discovered. Have you tried it yet?	./Story text files/355.txt	16793	21	6.034567901234568	1279	341	176	48.68639053254438	200	138	34	9.902366863905325	149	189	967	653	5	1.4934106483921983	1534	363
"Meet Miss Bandicota Miss Bandicota Bengalensis was a little Indian mole rat who grew up in a maze of burrows with her mother, seven sisters and ten brothers. They were terrific pests, the nineteen of them, always out on a rampage. One night she was out foraging as usual, when suddenly, she heard an angry human voice. Quick and nimble, she just managed to escape from the farmer's scary grasp. As she was fleeing, she looked into the eyes of a mole rat stuck in a trap. Those were the saddest eyes she had ever seen.She was so terrified that she huddled in her mother's burrow all night, her eyes tight shut. In the early hours of twilight she announced to everybody's dismay that she would never attack a farm again. All her brothers and sisters tried to change her mind, but she would not budge. She soon became bored and restless and realised that she couldn't sit in that same old burrow any longer. She quietly packed her explorer's kit with her sunglasses, binoculars, magnifying glass and, of course, her favourite  a strip of sticker bandages.Her mother was worried. ""Whatever will you do? Whatever else can you do? "" Miss Bandicota Bengalensis smiled and said simply, ""I can burrow. "" So she burrowed and burrowed and burrowed and burrowed. But there was never a dull moment, for every burrow she dug went to some place new. And she would never need to attack a farm again.On the Seashore Somebody raised her tiny nose out of a hole in the sand. Who was that? Miss Bandicota Bengalensis! She had just emerged from a new burrow after a long night of digging through sand and clay. The sun was going to rise. Just as she was about to set her sunglasses on top of her nose, she caught a glimpse of the world above.In a flash she was washed back into her burrow. As she struggled to find solid ground, she yelled frantically, ""Help, help! The river has burst it's banks! "" ""There's no need to panic. This is the Arabian Sea, "" said a calm and reassuring voice drifting nearby. A baffled Miss Bandicota Bengalensis scrambled out on to the soggy sand. As she shook her dripping tail, she felt the soft, wet ground sinking slowly beneath her.She was looking down at her toes uneasily, when she noticed something bright and blue floating between her feet! ""You've reached the beach of Bordi, seventeen kilometres of fabulous sticky sand! "" it said.In a fraction of a second, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis had grabbed the magnifying glass from her kit. The very next moment, she was keenly examining the fascinating little creature, as it lingered on, quite unperturbed by this sudden intrusion. It was a strangelooking animal; a round body, silvery grey in the middle, surrounded by a turquoisecoloured ring and numerous translucent tentacles branching out radially.""Who are you? "" asked Miss Bandicota Bengalensis inquisitively. ""You can call us Porpita. We are a colony of polyps, "" it said, swimming by lazily. ""I'm Miss Bandicota Bengalensis. Whatever is. . . er. . . are polyps? "" As you might already know, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis could never resist asking a question. ""Sort of like a family, "" it answered. ""We live together and work in unison. Some of us breathe, eat; some of us taste or feel and some of us make little new polyps. ""Miss Bandicota Bengalensis was most intrigued. ""That doesn't sound like my family at all. We all live in our own burrows, collect our own food and make our own baby mole rats. "" ""How quaint! "" remarked Porpita, ""It must be quite tiring to be a mole rat. "" ""Not at all, we. . . glug glug glug. . . glug. . . glug. . . "" Poor Miss Bandicota Bengalensis swallowed a mouthful of sea water as she was knocked over by a large wave. ""Thoo. . . thoo. . . thoo, "" she spat out, wincing at the horrid taste of salt water. Almost immediately, she leapt towards the shore, dodging another quick wave.As the waves subsided, she turned around to ask Porpita yet another question. And stopped in wonder. Scores of sparkling polyps, just like Porpita, were gliding leisurely over the rolling waves. It was as if the night sky had gently dropped countless twinkling stars into a magical sea. Miss Bandicota Bengalensis stood mesmerised by the polyps that dipped and rose gently with the waves of Bordi. She bid them a silent farewell as they faded into the tranquil waters.""Deeper! Deeper! "" An eager voice shook Miss Bandicota Bengalensis out of her daydream. Her drowsy eyes fell upon a couple of human kids digging the sands of Bordi with funnylooking tools. From her last trip to Kaas Pathar, the plateau of flowers, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis had learned that not every human was a danger to mole rats. So she rushed in to play. ""Can I dig too? "" she pleaded anxiously, ""I love to burrow! ""The kids shrieked and bolted, flinging their beach toys away. Miss Bengalensis looked baffled. She had grown up running away from humans. This was the first time she had seen humans run away from mole rats! ""We're not all out to catch you, you know? "" she hollered after them. But the kids had long disappeared.Miss Bandicota Bengalensis looked at a bright green toy lying next to her feet. She picked it up and made a futile attempt to dig with it. 'No wonder humans can't burrow! ' she thought to herself. She dropped it and began to stroll down the lonely shore.Further down the beach, she came upon a peculiar sight. Tiny balls of sand were scattered around in puzzling patterns. It was as if the seashore was dotted with constellations. 'The mystery of the curious sand balls! ' thought Miss Bandicota Bengalensis. Her face lit up. Holding up her magnifying glass, she was lost in her investigation.Suddenly, she felt a small pinch at the tip of her tail. Swinging around, she spotted a crab looking up at her. ""No need to be nasty! I was just looking, "" Miss Bandicota Bengalensis said reproachfully, tucking her tail between her legs. ""Sorry about that! I was just going about breakfast when your tail came in the way, "" said the crab apologetically. ""Oh, never mind! Mole rats nibble all day too. I know what you mean, "" replied Miss Bandicota Bengalensis, for she happened to be a very forgiving mole rat.""I'm Mrs. Scopimera, "" said the crab. ""I'm Miss Bandicota Bengalensis. Do you know where these tiny balls of sand came from? "" ""Oh, those are just sand bubbles! We make sand balls like that when we suck our food in. """"And do you make them yourself or do you also have a family to help you, like Porpita? "" asked Miss Bandicota Bengalensis. ""Oh! You mean the polyps? I've seen them stick together in rings, bobbing in the water all day. We sand bubblers are nothing like them, "" she said proudly. ""We wander the beach sands, sometimes in pairs, sometimes alone. "" ""We do have large families though, "" she continued. ""My children must be down there, up to some mischief or the other. Would you like to play with them? "" she said in a friendly voice.A little Scopimera peeped out of a hole and called, ""Come on, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis. We're buildinga maze! Will you help us with the burrows? "" ""Burrows? I love burrows! "" Miss Bandicota Bengalensis sprang into the nearest hole, head first. Immediately, she was stuck! She was upside down in the sticky sand, her head in a hole and her legs sticking out in the air. Not one to lose heart easily, she threw her kit into the hole and promptly started burrowing to make a tunnel. The little sand bubbler crabs were thrilled. They had never seen anyone burrow so fast! They all began digging industriously, some sideways, some backwards, some upside down and some all around. In no time the seashore of Bordi was dug up into a secret maze. Miss Bandicota Bengalensis wanted to try out every new tunnel in it!Can you help Miss Bandicota Bengalensis get back to her travel kit through the secret maze? Miss Bandicota Bengalensis scurried excitedly through the underground maze at lightning speed. She finally reached her travel kit with shining eyes and a triumphant smile. She had never crossed so many new burrows in such little time!As she climbed out of the hole, she gasped in horror, ""The sea has vanished! "" She scampered around in circles, only to turn back again and again, ""Gone! Disappeared! "" As her eyes grew bigger and rounder in shock, more and more Scopimera kids clutched at their tummies and rolled in laughter. Poor Miss Bandicota Bengalensis!""There! There! It's just low tide, "" said Mrs. Scopimera kindly, coming to her rescue. ""It's just low what? "" asked a puzzled Miss Bandicota Bengalensis. ""Low tide. The sea water recedes during low tide and returns when the tide is high. Nothing to worry about, you know, it happens twice a day. That's when we sand bubblers get to eat. We have to rush into our holes again when the waves return. "" ""But where does the sea go? "" ""Just far, far behind. The water only seems to disappear over the flat and gentle Bordi sands. If you look hard enough, you will see a foamy white line. That's where the shore is now. ""Miss Bandicota Bengalensis fished out her binoculars hastily. Sure enough, she could see the waves of the Arabian Sea in the distant horizon. She heaved sigh of relief and collapsed on the sand. All that running around had made her very hungry and very thirsty. So she she began yet another journey, this time in search of food and water.Mrs. Scopimera accompanied her down the beach, up to the rows of casuarina trees. There, she wished Miss Bandicota Bengalensis luck and returned to her children. Miss Bandicota Bengalensis trotted ahead, along the edge of the beach. Her legs began to hurt. The tip of her tail, where Mrs. Scopimera had pinched it, was smarting.Always prepared, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis stuck her sticker bandage around her tail. The strong little mole rat walked steadily on, even as the rays of the sun beat down upon her. After what seemed like a zillion steps, she reached a sharp bend in the road.As the coast turned inwards, to her joy, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis discovered a charming grove of chickoo trees. The branches, laden with soft brown fruit, swung low. The orchard grounds were strewn sweet ripe chickoos.A farm pond lay nestled in the shadows of a hundred trees. Miss Bandicota Bengalensis first rushed to the edge of the pond and drank to her heart's content. Now refreshed, she dashed around the trees, madly gathering a heap of chickoos. She made a heap any self respecting mole rat would be proud of!Pleased with the morning's work, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis leaned back to admire the most alluring pile of fruit she had ever seen. Her greedy fingers couldn't wait to poke into the soft ripe skin. Her greedy toes couldn't wait to jump on the pile. Nobody saw the very hungry mole rat pounce on the chickoos.But before long. . . A busy honey bee was foraging around in the afternoon, when she came upon an enormous pile of black and beady chickoo seeds. A happy mole rat lay curled in a hole beneath it. ""A good worker works all day and sleeps only at night, "" muttered the honey bee. A very sleepy Miss Bandicota Bengalensis turned over and murmured, ""Sleep at night? No, no, no, not at all. Tonight, I must dig a new burrow. . . ""Bandicota bengalensis, also known as the Indian mole rat, is a giant rat of South Asia. It is not related to the true bandicoot. They can be up to  cm long, including the tail. They are seen as pests because they damage cereal crops and gardens. They make piglike grunts when attacking. The name 'bandicoot' is derived from the Telugu word pandikokku, which translates to 'pigrat'.Did you know that Porpita porpita is also called the 'blue button jellyfish'? But it is actually not a jellyfish at all! As you now know, it is a colony of many tentacleshaped animals. They all float together and eat through a single mouth in the centre of the button!Can you believe that the chickoo (scientific name: Manilkara zapota) is not from India? It came from faraway Central American countries like Mexico. The chickoo travelled across the oceans with adventurers just like Miss Bandicota to reach the shores of India, maybe about  years ago.The sand bubbler crab does not have lungs. So how does it breathe? It has 'gas windows' on its legs, through which it takes in oxygen. At high tide, the land crab depends on the air trapped in its burrows. At low tide, it emerges, to feed and make sand bubbles."	./Story text files/332.txt	12330	23	5.837262357414449	1021	294	171	51.92274678111588	114	119	28	10.399141630901287	100	133	760	555	7	1.5143237841439041	1258	243

Mary Sangma and Josana Marak are nextdoor neighbours and best friends. One day, Josana showed Mary a waistband that she had spent days making.“I made it for my mother. What do you think?” Josana asked excitedly. “I don’t think she’ll ever wear it. I would never wear it,” Mary replied. Josana got up and left.The next morning, Mary waited for Josana. They walked to school together every day. But Josana had left without her.For lunch, Mary had brought the dried fish curry that Josana loved. But Josana ate with Caroline instead.That evening, Mary waited for Josana at home. She wanted to play with the toy cars that the two of them had built with her father. But Josana didn’t come. Mary looked at all the things she had built with Josana in the yard: the flute, the bird house, and the train track.She kept her car aside. She pulled two thick bamboo poles and lay them side by side. She lay a thinner pole across the two and tied it with cane, like she had seen her father do. She tied another pole in the same way, in the opposite direction. She placed many smaller poles one after the other and tied each of these down. Then she dusted her hands, and looked at what she had built. A long messy rectangle! Josana would have enjoyed building this, Mary thought.Mary tried lifting the rectangle and placing it on her shoulders. She stumbled. She tried again. This time it was easier.“Where to?” Samuel, her elder brother, asked. “To Josana’s,” Mary replied.There was Josana, in her usual spot. Mary scrambled up a tree near Josana. “Go away!” said Josana, frowning.Samuel climbed up and sat next to Mary. He gave her a rope to hold, and held one himself.Samuel and Mary took a deep breath, and pulled the rectangle up with all their might. KIRRRRICKKIRRRRICK. PHEW! They then made it lie flat between them.When Mary reached the other side, Josana was still frowning. Her eyes moved from Mary to the rectangle, and then back to Mary. “Do you think we can build a train to run on this?” Josana asked, breaking into a smile.From Here to There Mary builds a small bridge to reach her friend Josana. If their bridge is fixed onto the trees on both sides, this becomes a beam bridge. A beam bridge is the simplest type of bridge to build. These bridges may be big, made of steel and concrete, or they could be small, made of wood and stones. Have you ever spotted a beam bridge?	./Story text files/119.txt	2374	19	5.707509881422925	215	38	116	44.67307692307692	32	20	24	9.211538461538462	30	22	150	103	4	1.4270833333333333	257	31
If you travel around India from NORTH to SOUTH and from EAST to WEST, you will see people making things everywhere  in the fields, beside the road, in open doorways, and on verandahs. They make things to eat, to wear, to sell and to help build India and its people. And it’s all there for everyone to see. . . * Map of India on next page not to scaleHere are two Himachali women I met when I was walking in the Himalayan Mountains in Himachal Pradesh in the NORTH. Do you know what these women are doing? I have painted them with sheep because they are using SHEEP’S WOOL for what they are making. One woman SPINS the wool to make it into an even thread. The other is KNITTING a multicoloured, woolly jumper. Wool can be dyed all the colours of the rainbow. But I rather like the woman who is wearing a natural coloured outfitit’s the same colour as the brown sheep.This is a sight you see all over India : Women collecting water from a well to drink and cook with. These women are from Haryana in the NORTH. Well water is usually the cleanest and safest water to drink as it comes straight from deep under the ground, far from all the pollution that can seep into surface water. These women are wearing the typical North Indian dress the Salwar Kameez. Look at how well they balance two pots of water on their heads. Could you do that?I saw this man at work sitting outside his workshop in Karnataka in the SOUTH. He is a sculptor and he is using a hammer and a chisel to make an image of a god out of stone. Can you guess which one? * I have painted all the tools he uses for his work. I think they make interesting shapes all lined up together. Surrounding him are other sculptures he has made  of animals and people. Do you recognize any of them? *GaneshOn the edge of a forest in KARNATAKA I came across these women collecting FIREWOOD. They are wandering gypsies from a tribe called the BANJARA tribe. Look at the heavy jewellery they wear. But even HEAVIER must be these huge bundles of sticks they are carrying. Can you see how they have wound up pieces of cloth into a tight circle and placed it on their heads to help them balance the load? This also protects them from any thorns or spikes the sticks may have. Can you guess what fruit is growing on the trees?These women are also from KARNATAKA and they are helping MAKE one of the most important things to eat in India  RICE. Rice grows in flooded fields called PADDY FIELDS . Here the women are ankledeep in the paddies replanting the RICE SAPLINGSat regular intervals so that the rice will grow strong and healthy. Can you see how the women have tied up their sarees so that their clothes don’t get wet in the water? I think their backs must ache by the end of the day, don’t you?I saw these men mending a railway track in Goa on the SOUTHWEST coast of India. Can you see all the different tools they use? I like the fact that the workers’ uniforms use the colours of the Indian flag: orange, white and green. Can you see the man who is in charge of all the workers? I made the railway into the shape of a clock as trains have to be on time.I visited a village in Odisha in the EAST entirely made up of craftspeople. Everybody was sitting outside their houses and workshops MAKING things. This lady is a papiermache painter. She has painted, amongst other things, some brightly coloured images of JAGANNATH. Do you know who he is? He is Krishna by another name. Look at all the different patterns and the different colours the painter uses. She hopes to sell her wares to tourists and pilgrims. I like her elephant masks best, do you?Beside a dusty village road in Bengal in the EAST, I came upon this man  called a ‘thathera’*  beating tin strips into a bucket shape. First he decorated the tin by puncturing holes in its surface with a pin to make interesting patterns. Then he rolled the metal into a cylinder (as he is doing here) and making a great racket, he bashed the two ends together with small pins. Finally he attached the base of the bucket in the same way. They look very pretty, don’t you think? *This is the word in HindiThese people are making BRICKS. I like the way the name stamped on the brick is GOLD, as if they were nuggets of gold instead of bricks made out of baked earth. Here the women are taking some specially prepared BRICK CLAY and are shaping it in the rectangular wooden moulds. They slice off any excess clay with a strip of metal. Bricks are baked in a special oven called a KILN and the entire process of making a brick takes  DAYS. These ovens have tall, thin, towerlike chimneys. You can see these CHIMNEYS all over India, dotting the countryside. I saw these brickmakers in BENGAL.Travelling through BENGAL, I passed a lot of small, round ponds called Pukurs. There I saw these FISHERWOMEN carrying their round NETS with the day’s catch in the little BASKETS which they strap to their heads. I watched them catch fish. A group of women stood up to their waists in WATER, forming a row in the pond. They each splashed the water vigorously holding the bamboo rim of their nets. Then, altogether, they would dip their nets lower into the water, and, altogether, scoop up any fish. I have painted the fish their actual size. People like to eat them fried and crispy. Would you?I went to a wedding in RAJASTHAN in the WEST and I watched a huge wedding feast being prepared. These women were MAKING CHAPATIS. They sat in a circle, each person helping with one stage of the chapati making. So the first lady sieved the flour through a metal sheet with lots of holes in it. Another, adding water, kneaded it into dough with her fist. The next separated the dough into little balls, ready for the final rolling out into a chapati shape. A large plate of ready rolled chapatis was then whisked off into the kitchen to be cooked for the wedding feast.These women are ROAD BUILDERS. I saw them flattening out some rocky ground in RAJASTHAN. They used their picks and shovels to help clear a pathway through the desert. Later, a proper road for cars and trucks will be laid down. These women come from the RABARI tribe in Rajasthan. I was particularly struck by the colourful clothes they wore and the strength these women had to do this very hard work. Which lady is wearing the most bangles? And can you spot a tiffin box?	./Story text files/334.txt	6315	17	5.8592715231788075	500	104	182	69.96629213483146	28	61	34	14.191011235955056	19	70	347	257	5	1.488235294117647	594	86
It’s Rahah’s birthday next week. She’s excited about inviting her new friends to her party.“Who will you invite?” asks Mum. “You’ve only been at school a few months. The kids all seem so very different, don’t they?” “No, Mum. I have lots of new friends,” says Rahah.“I want to invite Zerina. She wants to be a ballerina, just like me!”“Oh lovely,” says Mum. “Let’s play some dance music then.”“I hope that Sikelele can come too. He sings in the school choir, just like me.”“Oh that’s good  we’ll all have fun singing too.”“Can we invite Susheela? She’s got fluffy kittens, just like me.”“Yes, let’s. She’ll have fun playing with our kittens too.”“And we must invite Yongnam. She loves pink cupcakes even more than I do.”“It’s lucky I’m making cupcakes then,” says Mum. “She can have the pink ones.”“Ah thanks, Mum! I can’t wait.” “Oh Rahah! I’m so excited to meet all your friends. They sound so special  just like you!”“But what about you? You love books, don’t you… just like me! Would you like to come to my party too?”Thank You!	./Story text files/395.txt	1032	10	5.6525423728813555	94	24	58	30.303030303030305	32	1	11	6.484848484848484	20	13	70	48	4	1.1884057971014492	127	11

Mary Sangma and Josana Marak are nextdoor neighbours and best friends. One day, Josana showed Mary a waistband that she had spent days making.“I made it for my mother. What do you think?” Josana asked excitedly. “I don’t think she’ll ever wear it. I would never wear it,” Mary replied. Josana got up and left.The next morning, Mary waited for Josana. They walked to school together every day. But Josana had left without her.For lunch, Mary had brought the dried fish curry that Josana loved. But Josana ate with Caroline instead.That evening, Mary waited for Josana at home. She wanted to play with the toy cars that the two of them had built with her father. But Josana didn’t come. Mary looked at all the things she had built with Josana in the yard: the flute, the bird house, and the train track.She put her cars aside. She pulled two thick bamboo poles and laid them side by side. She lay a thinner pole across the two and tied it with cane, like she had seen her father do. She tied another pole in the same way, in the opposite direction. She placed many smaller poles one after the other and tied each of these down. Then she dusted her hands, and looked at what she had built. A long, messy rectangle! Josana would have enjoyed building this, Mary thought.Mary tried lifting the rectangle and placing it on her shoulders. She stumbled. She tried again. This time it was easier.“Where to?” Samuel, her elder brother, asked. “To Josana’s,” Mary replied.There was Josana, in her usual spot. Mary scrambled up a tree near Josana. “Go away!” said Josana, frowning.Samuel climbed up and sat next to Mary. He gave her a rope to hold, and held one himself.Samuel and Mary took a deep breath, and pulled the rectangle up with all their might. KIRRRRICKKIRRRRICK. PHEW! They then made it lie flat between them.When Mary reached the other side, Josana was still frowning. Her eyes moved from Mary to the rectangle, and then back to Mary. “Do you think we can build a train to run on this?” Josana asked, breaking into a smile.From Here to There Mary builds a small bridge to reach her friend Josana. If their bridge is fixed onto the trees on both sides, this becomes a beam bridge. A beam bridge is the simplest type of bridge to build. These bridges may be big, made of steel and concrete, or they could be small, made of wood and stones. Have you ever spotted a beam bridge?	./Story text files/45.txt	2376	19	5.715415019762846	215	38	116	44.71153846153846	32	20	24	9.211538461538462	30	22	150	103	4	1.4270833333333333	257	31

Little Goat is ready for school. His coat is nice and shiny. His hair is neatly oiled and combed.When he reaches school, he holds Baba Goat’s hand tightly. “The school is so big! I keep getting lost,” he whispers to Baba Goat. “Don’t worry,” says Baba Goat. “There are so many goats like you here. You will have fun.” But Little Goat is worried about the big goats with their curly horns.Timidly, he walks to his class. Billu Ma’am tells them to stand in a line and sing the Goat Song. “Maa Maa Maango Baa Baa Baambooo Paa Paa Paapaayaa Nee Nee Neeemboo”Little Goat really likes the song. But he can’t remember all the words, so he makes up his own. “Maa Maa Mammaaa Baa Baa Babbaa Paa Paa Pappaaa Nee Nee Neat and Cleeeen”Little Goat sings loudly and clearly. He keeps singing even when the others have stopped. “No no! You must not make your own words! Stop singing!” Billu Ma’am scolds Little Goat. She sends him to the corner. “Ha! Ha!” The other goats laugh at him.After some time, it’s Games period. “Jump!” Hoppy Ma’am, the P. T. teacher, tells them. Little Goat sees a line of ants. Where could they be going? He starts crawling behind the ants. “No crawling!” Hoppy Ma’am scolds. “Ha! Ha!” The other goats laugh at him.Little Goat is sad. At lunch time, no one sits with him or talks to him. Plop plop! Tears fall into his lunch of freshly cut green grass, making it salty.That evening, Little Goat tells Ma all about singing the Goat Song and Games period. Ma comforts Little Goat. “You made up a lovely song! You crawled so quietly!” She hugs him and gives him an extra kiss before he sleeps.Next day, Little Goat is careful to sing the song correctly. During the Games period, he remembers to jump and does not crawl.Then, it is Art period. “Draw straight lines and wavy lines!” Dotty Ma’am tells the class. Little Goat spots a colourful butterfly with black and red lines and dots on its wings. Little Goat draws the butterfly instead. Dotty Ma’am is not happy. “Little Goat, I told you to draw only straight and wavy lines! Why did you draw a butterfly?” she scolds. “Ha! Ha!” The other goats laugh at him.That day at lunch time, Little Goat sits alone again and eats his cucumbers. Suddenly, a small voice speaks near him. “Will you teach me how to draw a boat?” It’s Piggy Piglet from the pig class. She’s littler than Little Goat.“I don’t know how to draw a boat,” says Little Goat. “Oh, but everyone says you drew a boat in class today,” snuffles Piggy. “It was a butterfly,” Little Goat tells her. Piggy looks at him with such big eyes that Little Goat starts to draw in the dust.Soon Little Goat has drawn a butterfly, a boat and a tree. Piggy gathers some fallen leaves and flowers and adds them to the picture. “Let us pretend we are in a garden!” Piggy suggests. “I know a new song!” Little Goat bursts out. They jump around and sing a Goat and Pig Song.After school, Little Goat tells Ma all about his new friend. ” Will you give me some extra crunchy apple peels to take for Piggy tomorrow?” Little Goat pleads. “Of course!” Ma promises.That night, Little Goat falls asleep quickly. In his dream, he sees Piggy and all the big goats with curly horns dancing in a garden. “Jump, hop, skip, KICK! Let’s all say a loud ‘Maaaa! ’ Jump, hop, skip, KICK! Let’s all say a soft ‘Baaa! ’ Jump hop skip. . .” Right up front Little Goat is the leader of this new dance. He sighs and happily dreams some more.	./Story text files/233.txt	3422	15	5.353658536585366	362	48	110	35.806451612903224	68	25	20	7.763440860215054	62	31	228	182	3	1.165631469979296	463	20
Basava and his sister Sundari sat on the sand watching the sun rise over the sea. Slowly, the sky turned from grey to blue and the edges of the clouds became an orange colour. They sat staring at the horizon – that line in the distance where the bowl of the sky seemed to curve down to meet the sea. Their father was a sailor who had sailed away on a merchant ship many months ago. The children were eagerly waiting for him to come back home. So, every morning at sunrise, they came and waited by the beach hoping to see the tall red sails of their father’s ship rise slowly above the horizon. The children had seen many ships come and go because they lived in Mamallapuram, which was a busy port. The ships came from many distant lands carrying exciting cargo – chests of silk and pottery, jars full of wine, perfumes and even horses. Their father’s ship had sailed out carrying logs of cedar and sandalwood, and bags of spices, rice and ghee. “It’s been so many months,” Sundari said sadly, “Appa has never been away for so long.” “Remember that big storm last week?” Basava added worriedly, “The sea was full of high waves. I hope Appa’s ship is safe.”“Look, a ship is coming!” said Sundari excitedly, “But I can’t see the sails.” As they watched eagerly, a ship appeared on the horizon. It was a small dot that slowly grew larger as it came closer. First, they saw the sails filling out with the wind. Then the high masts and the wooden bow rose into view. “No,” said Basava, disappointed, “Appa’s ship has red sails with a flying eagle painted on them. This one has black and green sails.” They felt disappointed and decided to go home. They had work to do — they had to help their mother at her vegetable stall in the market. Their father was often away from home and after a while all the money he left behind would get over. That is why their mother sold vegetables, so that they had enough to eat. Sundari enjoyed working at the vegetable stall. The market was such an interesting place! Often their customers were sailors from different lands – some with pale skins and narrow tilted eyes and some with dark skins and curly hair. They wore odd clothes and jewellery and spoke in languages Sundari could not understand at all!This morning, as Basava was laying out bundles of spinach and cabbage, one of their regular customers came to buy vegetables. She was the wife of a trader who often sent spices to other lands by ship. She knew all about the ships coming and going from Mamallapuram. As she picked through the radishes and beans, the trader’s wife asked, “Any news of your father?” Sundari shook her head sadly. “Why don’t you go and ask at the jetty where all the ships are anchored?” she said. “Ask what?” Basava leaned forward eagerly. “Ask the sailors if they have seen your father’s ship on their way to Mamallapuram. My husband does that quite often when his ships are late.” That afternoon, the children headed towards the main jetty. They went through the market and took the street going towards the sea. They went past the warehouses where the merchants kept the goods meant to be loaded into ships. In one warehouse, labourers were unloading bags of pepper and coriander seeds. In another, they were stacking up bales of cotton cloth woven in bright colours.Three ships stood anchored at the jetty, tied to the shore by thick ropes. Two more ships were waiting out at sea. Small boats were moving in and out among them with the boatmen selling everything from flowers and fruits to beads and woodcarvings. Among the ships anchored at the jetty was the ship with the black and green sails that they had seen in the morning. They went towards a ship that was being loaded with goods. As they neared it, a soldier carrying a spear stopped them. “Halt! Watch where you are going!” the man yelled. “No one is allowed on this ship without a royal permit.” “Permit?” Sundari looked puzzled. “Why?” “Because it is a royal ship, you silly girl!” “You mean this ship belongs to the royal navy?” Basava’s eyes widened in surprise. “Are we going to war?” “Of course not! This is a trading ship. His Majesty King Narasimha Varman owns many ships that trade with far off kingdoms. This one is going to the port of Tamralipti in the north.” “We are looking for a ship that has come from the kingdom of Kamboja…” Sundari began hesitantly.“Our father is a sailor and he sailed for Kamboja many months ago. We want to ask the sailors if they have seen his ship.” “Kamboja?” the soldier asked. He then pointed to the ship with the black and green sails and said, “That ship’s arrived from there.” Basava and Sundari ran to the ship, up the gangplank and on to its deck. They stopped when they saw that all the sailors on board were foreigners. They were speaking to each other in a strange tongue! “Oh no!” Basava sighed. “How do we make them understand us?” “Easy!” Sundari grinned. “We talk to them like Amma does when they come to buy vegetables.” “Of course!” laughed Basava, “We act and make signs with our hands.” They looked around trying to spot a sailor with a friendly face. Finally, they went up to a sailor sitting on a roll of rope.He was an old man with a dark, leathery, sunburnt face. There were deep lines around his narrow eyes. He wore loose pyjamas, a sleeveless jacket, bright bangles and earrings. “Kamboja?” Sundari asked nervously. The man nodded happily, “Kamboja!” Basava pointed to the sail, then he pointed to the red skirt Sundari was wearing and said, “Ship? Red sail?” The man frowned and shook his head. Sundari tried to explain. She tapped the side of the ship and said, “Ship?” Then she pointed to the sails and to her skirt, “Sail? Red?” The man pointed to the sea and said something in his own language. “Yes! A ship with red sails. Have you seen it?” Sundari asked excitedly. The man looked a bit puzzled. “Our father… Appa!” Sundari was acting out a tall man with a moustache. “Oh!” The man then flapped his arms to mimic a bird flying.“YES!” the children jumped and yelled in delight, “A flying eagle is on the sail!” The man was laughing as he stood up and pulled them by their hands to the other end of the ship. Then he pointed to the horizon where a ship was slowly sailing towards them, its red sails blowing proudly in the breeze. Basava and Sundari were speechless! There, before their eyes, were the familiar high masts, the curving prow, the red sails with flying eagles. . . “Your Appa is a sailor?” the man asked gently, looking at their delighted faces. “Is he on that ship?” “Oh!” The children stared at him in disbelief. “You can speak our language!” Sundari exclaimed. “A little bit,” the man laughed. “I come to Mamallapuram often. But I did enjoy your acting, especially ‘the tall man with the moustache’ part!” Basava and Sundari taught their sailorfriend many new words as they stood at the jetty, waiting happily for the ship to come home.. Basava and Sundari lived over  years ago in the kingdom of King Narasimha Varman of the famous Pallava dynasty. The Pallava kingdom extended over presentday Tamil Nadu. . The town of Mamallapuram is near Chennai and is famous for its temples. At one time, it was a port from where ships sailed to Cambodia, Burma and Indonesia. Kamboja is the ancient name of Cambodia and Tamralipti was a port in Bengal.. What did children study in school in the Pallava times? The subjects included logic, law, mathematics, grammar, astronomy, philosophy, the Vedas, economics and politics. . Women, especially of noble families, were educated, but were not allowed to study the Vedas. . People in the Pallava times dyed their hair, used scented hair oil and perfumes. They even used toothpicks after their meals!	./Story text files/98.txt	7707	15	5.818987341772152	646	144	150	52.9020979020979	67	76	29	10.65034965034965	61	82	471	319	5	1.509761388286334	784	138
Dadu and Muznah love watching clouds. “Did you know that your name comes from the clouds? Muznah means the cloud that carries the rain,” says Dadu.There are so many shapes in the clouds–a cauliflower, a moustache, a crescent moon. Muznah spots a dogshaped one. “It has such a biiiiig nose!”“See that cloud there? I know of an animal that looks just like it,” says Dadu. “Really?” asks Muznah excitedly.“It’s called a whale and it lives in the ocean.” “Tell me more!” says Muznah. “Well, there are many kinds of whales, but the size of this cloud makes me think of a blue whale. The blue whale is the biggest animal that has ever lived on Earth, much bigger than a dinosaur and much, much bigger than an elephant,” says Dadu.“Sooooooooooooooo big!” says Muznah. “It’s so big that you would be able to sit inside its heart,” explains Dadu.“Your dog’s nose is floating away,” laughs Dadu. “Maybe the nose doesn’t like the dog anymore,” Muznah giggles. “Arre! It’s floating towards the whalecloud. What will the whale do with a nose? Fish need gills, not a nose to breathe underwater.”“That is true for a fish. But the blue whale is not a fish. It breathes air and so it has a nose,” says Dadu. “It must have the BIGGEST nose in the world! How does it breathe air, if it lives underwater?”“Whales are very special,” explains Dadu. “They breathe at the surface of the ocean.” “Ooooooo. . . so the whale swims in backstroke?” Muznah asks.“You have a vivid imagination, Muznah!” laughs Dadu. “The whale's nose is on its back!”In fact, says Dadu, the sound of a whale breathing can be heard from far, far away. “The whale takes a breath, goes under water, comes out of the water again, and goes PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF. Each breath creates a fountain on top of the whale’s nose.”Muznah gazes at the whalecloud. “The whale with the nose on its back is moving towards us, Dadu!” She lies on her back, her arms tucked in like fins. Waving her arms, Muznah shouts, “I’m a whale too. . .. . . PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, hello whale!”Whale Watching! Here are some fun facts about whales. Whales are of many shapes and sizes, and live in all the oceans of the planet. They even breathe out fountains in different shapes and sizes! Scientists who study them can tell different whales apart by observing their breathing.Blue whales don’t have teeth. Instead, they eat very small animals by swallowing a large amount of water and then filtering the animals in their baleen plates. They are mammals, which means they have babies, just like we do. Their babies are called calves. The calves swim with their mothers for years to learn all the wisdom needed to live happily in the oceans.Crossing the Line During summer, a mother whale and her calf move towards the polar regions, where there is more food. In winter, when the polar seas freezes, they move towards the tropics. Whales which live in the Southern hemisphere never cross over to the North. Those that live in the North never cross over to the South. Since the equator is not a real line in the oceans, only the whales know why they do not cross it! Even with all our technology, we still do not know how they do it.	./Story text files/52.txt	3176	45	6.091194968553459	262	56	146	45.04347826086956	42	27	28	9.072463768115941	35	34	180	138	5	1.3482849604221636	354	25
Khrrrrrrr. . . “Oh no,” wails Shyam. The seams of his favourite shirt have come apart. “I can’t wear this shirt anymore, Thatha!”“Of course you can, silly,” his grandfather says. “We can repair it!” Thatha takes a needle and a spool of blue thread. He shows Shyam how to stitch the seams together.Shyam’s friend Shrisha has come home. “Let’s go cycling,” she says. “In a minute,” says Shyam. “Let me iron my shirt first.” He switches on the iron box. But the light doesn’t glow, and the iron remains cold. “Ufff! I’ll just wear the crumpled shirt,” grumbles Shyam. “I was at the Repair Mela last week,” says Shrisha. “George Uncle, who teaches chemistry in my brother’s college, was repairing an iron box. I watched what he was doing very closely. Let’s try to set it right! Do you have a screwdriver?”Shyam hunts in the cupboard and gets a screwdriver. Shrisha unscrews the back of the iron. “See this wire? When you switch on the power, electric current passes through it and heats up the iron plate. This process is called conduction,” says Shrisha.“And this small thing is the thermostat. It makes sure that the iron doesn’t get too hot. If the heat goes way up, it just cuts off the power. The red light goes out. When the iron cools down, the current flows again and the light comes on.”“Other heating devices must work the same way, right? Geysers, kettles, ovens?” But Shrisha is not listening. She’s peering into the iron.“What’s wrong?” asks Shyam. “I don’t think I can repair it.” “Oh no! Appa and Amma will scold us when they see what we have done to the iron box!” “We’ll take it to the Repair Mela! They’ll help us.”Before Shyam's parents can ask them about the iron box, he and Shrisha take it and sneak out on their cycles to the Repair Mela.“Aunty, can you help us repair this iron box?” Shrisha asks Anupama Aunty. “What’s wrong with it?” “It won’t switch on!” says Shrisha. Anupama Aunty takes out a little box with wires and knobs. “This is a multimeter,” she says. “It checks if all parts of the iron are allowing electric current to flow. Let’s start with the plug.”Next, she tests all the other parts, until she comes to a small wire. “See this wire next to the plug? It’s broken, even though it doesn’t look damaged—there’s your problem!”She cuts out the old wire and plug, and fixes a new wire and plug to the iron box. “Let’s test it.” She switches it on, and the light glows.After helping out at the Mela and observing repairs for a while, they decide to head home.“Oh no, the rear tyre has a puncture. Let’s take it to Manigandan Anna!” says Shrisha. “Puncture? No problem,” says Manigandan Anna, who has a small cycle repair shop in the neighbourhood. He has been invited to the Repair Mela.He turns the cycle upside down. He takes a pair of tyre levers and pries the tyre away from the metal rim. Soon the inner tube is out. “Can you see a hole anywhere?” Anna asks the children. They can’t. “Then how do you tell where the puncture is?” he asks. The children look at him cluelessly.He immerses the tube, part by part, in a tub halffilled with water. At one point, they see small bubbles rising. “See? That’s where the hole is!” He cuts a small piece of rubber from an old tube. After rubbing the surface of the tube around the hole with sandpaper, he applies a rubber adhesive to the tube and the piece of rubber.“Come, seal this,” he says. Shyam puts the piece of rubber on the hole and presses it down. “If not for professionals who fix cycles, umbrellas, footwear and other things, we would have mountains of waste all over!” says Shyam.The tyre is fixed, the iron is fixed and Shrisha and Shyam ride back home. It is a day well spent!Don’t throw it. Fix it There is an urgent need to decrease the amount of non biodegradable waste that humans generate. Repair encourages a more efficient use of resources than the take, make and waste culture that is replacing our traditional way of make, preserve and reuse.Raw materials used in products often need a lot of energy to be mined and processed to make them usable by manufacturers. The process of repair helps conserve these resources and extends the life of the product. Only when something cannot be repaired should you think of recycling it.The tradition of recycling In India, we have a strong tradition of recycling, whether it is organic waste like food or inorganic waste like clothes. While their numbers have reduced greatly, we still find kabadiwalas who collect old newspaper and recyclable household metal and plastic waste, and street peddlers who take in your old clothes in return for new steel utensils.Repair Café This story is inspired by Repair Café Bengaluru that conducts free workshops where people from different generations come together and keep alive the culture of repairing things. At a Repair Café, you’ll find tools and materials to help you make any repairs you need. Repair enthusiasts and professionals like cobblers, umbrella repairers, alteration tailors and watch repairers work with visitors at these workshops. After any natural calamity, repair professionals are in high demand. In less than three years, Repair Café Bengaluru has prevented over ,  kg of items from going to the waste heap.

Raju lived in the city. But in the summer, when school was out, Raju headed straight for his Ajja’s house in the village.Every summer, he learnt something new at Ajja’s house. This time, he was to learn that in the village, milk does not come out of plastic sachets!The evening he arrived, Ajji took him to the cowshed behind the house. Four gentle brown cows were munching on the hay Ajji had collected for them.A couple of frisky young calves jumped around playfully. Raju enjoyed watching them. He thought they were very sweet.“Raju, remember the glass of milk you just had? This is the cow that the milk came from!” said Ajji. “The milk I drank came from a cow?” asked Raju, very surprised. “You mean you just milked her and there was my glass of milk, ready to drink?”“Yes, Raju,” smiled Ajji. “Come and meet my cows. This is Kaveri, whose milk you just drank, this is Kapila, this one is Ganga, and there at the far corner is Gowri.” Raju stood where he was, looking at the cows doubtfully. “Come, Raju,” coaxed Ajji. “Come and touch them. They won’t hurt you.”As Raju moved among them, the calves moved closer to their mothers and mooed, wondering if they could trust this stranger. Their mothers licked them, letting them know Raju was a friend.Raju picked up courage and reached up to touch Gowri’s neck. It felt all soft and wrinkly, somewhat like Ajji’s neck. Gowri mooed at Raju’s touch, wanting to be friends.“Do you know how milk comes out of the cow, Raju?” asked Ajji.“No, Ajji,” said Raju, feeling a little silly. “All I know is that in the city, our milk comes to our door in plastic sachets.”“Come, let me show you,” said Ajji. Taking him by the hand, she led him to Kapila. Kapila’s calf was close by.Ajji first allowed the calf to suckle, and drink as much milk as she needed. Then she washed Kapila’s udders with water and cleaned them. Sitting on her haunches, she began to milk the cow, pressing the udders gently between finger and thumb.As Raju watched, milk spurted from the udders into the vessel below. The vessel began to fill up slowly and the milk began to turn frothy at the top. Raju was surprised and pleased to see the frothy milk.“Ajji,” he said excitedly, “see how the bubbles are forming at the top!” “Yes, Raju,” said Ajji, smiling at his excitement. “When I pull on the udders, powerful jets of milk come out. They hit the surface of the milk in the vessel with great force, mixing with the air and forming bubbles. That is what makes fresh milk taste so different from milk that comes out of a packet!”“Wow! I had no idea!” said Raju. Ajji boiled the fresh frothy milk in the kitchen, and poured out a glass for Raju. It tasted so good that Raju finished it in a few quick gulps.“Ajji, when I go back to the city, I shall tell all my friends where milk comes from,” said Raju. “I shall tell them how good fresh milk tastes at my Ajji's house.” Ajji laughed happily. “Do that, my little Raju,” she said. “Then everyone will know who is the cleverest boy in the class !”Use your imagination and colour this picture any way YOU like.Use your imagination and colour this picture any way YOU like.	./Story text files/65.txt	3134	15	5.7250755287009065	285	46	122	53.05172413793103	25	33	24	10.793103448275861	20	38	209	122	5	1.4693333333333334	346	29
"Captain Raju steered the fighter jet to a sharp left, just missing the Eiffel Tower. ""Phew! Paris is certainly a tricky place to fly in, "" he thought, heart beating fast. Suddenly, he heard a noise from the cockpit – *BEEP BEEP BEEP* What was it? Was he on enemy ground? Did the engine have a problem?*BEEP BEEP BEEP* Raju woke up with a start at the sound of the alarm. ""It was all just a dream, "" he sighed. But, wait. There’s no time for disappointment! Today was a big day.""I am going to take my first aeroplane ride! Amma, I’m awake!

""Raju was inside an airport for the first time in his life. He helped his mother lift the suitcase on to a moving belt. The belt carried the bags into a big machine. A strict lady in a uniform was looking at a small screen behind the machine. Raju was shocked when he looked at the screen. It showed not just his bag but everything inside it— his new sports shoes, his binoculars, everything! ""Xray vision! Just like Captain Raju has. . . "" gasped Raju. Raju opened his mouth to ask the lady something, but his mother stopped him. ""Hush, Raju. She is on the security team. She has to make sure passengers are not carrying dangerous items like explosives or weapons. Best not to disturb her. ""At last, Raju found himself in a large hall. The walls were made of glass and he could see dozens of aeroplanes outside. One was about to take off. ""Pilots have such important jobs, don’t they, Amma? "" ""Of course. Just like bus drivers or ship captains, they are responsible for the safe travel of so many passengers. """"Chechi is so lucky. She’s been on so many planes! I can’t wait till I’m old enough.

It started slowly, but in a few seconds it was going so fast that Raju felt his seat vibrate. Suddenly, the shaking stopped. The giant plane was in the air! ""Amma, we’re flying! "" ""We are! Listen, Raju. They’re making an announcement. Shhh! "" Someone’s voice came from the speakers. A familiar voice. . .""Ladies and gentlemen, this is your Captain, Arya. Welcome aboard! "" ""Chechi!

One Day Mac was out in the garden chasing The Cat, when suddenly, something caught his attention. It was Dipper. She was digging at something by the fence. He bounded over to where she was busy with the fence to find out what was going on. “Whatcha doing Dipper?” Mac asked, sniffing at the fence where she was digging. “I think I found a hole!” Dipper announced proudly. “A hole?” questioned Mac. “Yes a 'hole',” Dipper replied enthusiastically. “What's a hole?” asked Mac. “Er – well, a hole is something that's not there.” replied Dipper.Mac thought about this carefully. What's the use of having something that's not there? He thought to himself. He paused, not wanting to seem stupid. Then, looking at Dipper studiously, he decided to ask anyway. “What's the big thing about something that isn't there?” he asked. “Well,” said Dipper, “when something isn't there, there is nothing to stop us going through.” “Going through?” said Mac, “Well, what is the point in going through?” Dipper looked dreamily into the distance, and paused a while before answering. She paused so long that Mac had almost forgotten what they were talking about, and had begun to wonder where The Cat was. . . .“If we go through, we can see what is on– The Other Side!” Dipper finally answered triumphantly. Mac, interrupted from his thoughts about the Cat, now wondered what the big deal was. Who cares what's on The Other Side, he thought, I've got all this nice stuff here. I don't want to go to The Other Side, why would I want to go to there? Dipper was young and inquisitive, and since she had found the hole she just couldn't keep her mind off finding out what was on. . . . The Other Side! The Other Side! The Other Side! The Other Side! “Yep – there's definitely a HOLE here,” said Dipper, “and if we go through, we'll be on – The Other Side!” . Dipper was fascinated, she couldn't go to The Other Side without someone with her, and then she could only go where they wanted her to go. What was the rest like? Why couldn't she go there, alone? What interesting things were out there on The Other Side? She wondered excitedly. Now here was her chance to find out!Mac did not like the look of the hole. He thought The Other Side was dangerous, and he didn't want to go somewhere dangerous. He had a bad feeling about it, after all, he thought, if it wasn't dangerous, why wouldn't he be allowed to go there? Mr and Mrs Smith looked after him, and if they didn't want him to go to The Other Side, there must be a good reason. Dipper was too young to reason so well, all she saw was that The Other Side was OUT THERE to be explored, and she wanted to go there!“Mac – I think I can get through here!” Dipper yelped. “Uh, I really don't think you should do that Dipper,” Mac woofed back. “Why not?” Dipper retorted, then quickly added “Don 't be silly Mac, you're scared of everything.” hoping Mac might forget to answer. “I am not!” Mac defended. “I just think there is a good reason why we can't go there.” “Yeah – well what is the reason?” Dipper asked.  “Uh, I dunno, but I uh. . .” Mac replied, he still had that bad feeling, but Dipper was too excited to notice. “Common, let's go!” Before Mac could stop her, she was through the fence and on The Other Side! The Other Side The Other Side The Other Side Mac didn't want to follow her, he thought she might not be brave enough to leave his sight if he stayed behind the fence. Then, something happened that made him rethink.A small black and white object darted across the road and disappeared behind some bushes, with two pairs of eyes following. The two dogs looked at each other, then back across the road, and then at each other again. “THE CAT!” They shouted together. Dipper started running towards where The Cat disappeared, while Mac began squeezing himself through the Dipper size hole. It took a bit of struggling, but before long he was through the hole and bounding across the road to look for The Cat. Dipper was rummaging around the bushes when he arrived. “Where's The Cat, Dipper? Where is she?” He snuffed, out of breath from the squeeze through the hole and the following chase. “She must be here somewhere, I know it,” said Dipper, furiously sniffing around. Mac joined her, and began furiously sniffing too. After a few minutes, their sniffing slowed, and then stopped. The started looking around, then they looked back at each other again. “She disappeared,” said Dipper. “ Yes – I know,” replied Mac, “she's gone.”Mac was about to say, “Let's go back, this is not right” , when Dipper interrupted his thoughts, “Look – over there, it's a small brown furry thing. What is it? Where's it going? ?” She didn't wait for Mac to reply but started running after the little creature. “Er – I think it's a 'SQUIRREL' Dipper!” He again forgot why he wasn't supposed to be out there and started running behind her. After all, squirrels could not be left alone  not if there was a chance to catch them! They darted and dived through the bushes, chasing the squirrel. Every time they got close the squirrel darted off again, but never far enough that they lost sight of his bushy tail. The chase went on for some time, until, finally. . . Just when they thought they had the squirrel cornered. . . He disappeared into hole, and, just like The Cat – he was GONE.Frumph. . . Mac sank down on his paws. Frumph . . . Dipper followed. “Mac – ” she called, “it's not too bad.” “Why's that – what do you mean it's not too bad? ? ?” Mac responded forlornly. “Well, we are on The Other Side now, we can explore and see what everything on The Other Side is!” Dipper explained. “But. . .” Mac tried to protest, he kept thinking there was something wrong with the situation, but he couldn't put his paw on it. Dipper started sniffing around and checking this way and that. There were so many new smells to sniff, and she wanted to check out all of them. Mac reluctantly looked on. Each time she found a new smell, it was a bit further away. Mac followed just close enough to keep an eye on her, always staying within woofing distance.Whenever she found a new smell, she called back to him.  “Mac – check over here, it smells like there were some other dogs here. . .” .  “Mac – this smells like sweet flowers. . .”  “Mac, there was some other animal here – maybe it's another squirrel. . .” Mac, still followed, not wanting her to get in trouble, but also not wanting to miss out on the action. Not quite brave enough to look himself, and not quite bold or scared enough to try to stop her, but too much of a friend to leave her alone and go back home. Mac might have been stuck in this dilemma for ever, had not something else happened.They came out of the bushes into a clearing, and Mac saw the sun. “Dipper – it's going to be dark soon! We can't be out here on our own in the dark.” Gruffed Mac. “Dark – it's not getting dark.” She replied. “Look at the sun!” Mac pointed to the fading yellow ball. Looking up, Dipper suddenly saw he was right. “Okay, I guess we could come back, some other time.” She was completely absorbed in the excitement and was worried they might never see these things again, the sun had not yet brought her back to reality.  “Let's go NOW Dipper!” Mac growled, as he was becoming very worried about their safety. They started back towards where they thought they had come from, quickly running through the bushes. As they ran the light grew dimmer and dimmer, and as the light grew dimmer they had to tread slower and more carefully to keep from tripping over branches and getting tangled on twigs. Still the light grew dimmer, and then it grew darker, and Mac got more and more worried.He knew it wasn't a good idea to be out here. “Mac – It doesn't look so much like where we came.” said Dipper timidly. “Er – no, it doesn't,” Mac rolled his big droopy eyes. What were they going to do? He decided to try not to look too miserable yet, for Dipper's sake. “It's okay, we'll find our way back, and we'll be warm and comfortable on the INSIDE soon. Inside, in the dog house, with our blankets and food bowls before you can say. . . .” Mac trailed off.  “Before you can say?” Dipper queried.  “Before you can say. . . .” Mac still couldn't finish what he was trying to say, he was worried they really might not get back. Dipper started looking about and sniffing. Now all the smells that had smelled so interesting, began to smell very scary. The sounds that sounded so interesting sounded haunted and spooky. The night was getting colder and chillier, she missed her blanket, and her bowl and her. . . .Mac suddenly remembered the reason why they shouldn't go out – because they might get lost! Not only that – all those spooky sounds didn't just sound spooky, they WERE spooky. And, worse still, they might get hurt. He started treading more and more cautiously, “Stay close to me Dipper.” he called. Mac also started thinking about home, with his warm blanket and his food. There was another reason they shouldn't have left, The Other Side didn't have any ready made food or blankets around. Why couldn't he remember all these things before they left? Better keep Dipper's spirits up, he thought, and turned his mind back to the task at hand. He tried to finish the sentence again “We'll be home before you can say. . . . . .” “ . . . . Before you can say. . . – There's THE CAT! ! !” Dipper looked up suddenly.He was right, it WAS The Cat! Just when Dipper had started to think she would never get home. The Cat would know how to find home. If they just kept her in sight, they would eventually find their way back. They didn't know how, but they knew The Cat never got lost. They stayed a short distance behind the cat, so she wouldn't run like she normally did when they chased her. Slowly but surely, things started getting more and more familiar, until finally they saw the fence again where they had first found the hole. But, the hole wasn't there anymore, someone had fixed it. Outside the gate, they could see Tyron calling: “Dipper. . . Mac. . . . . , where are you, Dipper. . . Mac. . .” He looked and sounded so worried. There was no sneaking in now. Mac remembered the other reason why they shouldn't go out.Mr Smith! Once inside, they both got smacked on their bottoms by Mr Smith for the naughty escapade, to make them never forget why not to go out, and then they were sent to bed without their supper. But Mac and Dipper didn't care, they were just very glad to be back home, on the INSIDE, SAFE and WARM.MMMMyyyy PPPPiiiiccccttttuuuurrrreeeeThe End The End The End The EndAbout the Author Danielle Bruckert Danielle is a New Zealander living abroad, who now calls Africa home.

It was dawn. In her nest, Kaage the crow woke up and looked around, bored. She cleared her throat and cawed a few times. Boring. Then, suddenly, she pricked up her ears. A koel was singing his sweet song somewhere nearby.For a while, Kaage enjoyed the song. Then she got mad. It just wasn't fair! It was she who had warmed the egg that the koel had hatched from, and now that little bird was singing so much better than her! But she should not be jealous, she told herself. The thing to do was to take singing lessons from the koel.Kaage went looking for the koel, and found her at last. The koel looked at her a little suspiciously, but Kaage was very respectful. “Will you teach me to sing?” Kaage asked humbly. “All right,” said the koel. “But on one condition. You have to be here very early each morning, at daybreak.” Kaage nodded. “Good. Class begins tomorrow,” said the koel, flying off on her errands.Kaage loved her sleep, and never woke up before sunrise. But she had her first singing lesson the next morning at daybreak! She wound up her alarm clock and set it before she went to bed. When the alarm rang, Kaage jumped out of bed, rubbed the sleep out of her eyes, and rushed to class.The koel was waiting impatiently. As soon as Kaage landed on a nearby branch, the music lesson began. “Now, let me hear you sing this,” said the koel. “Kuhoo, kuhoo…” Eagerly, Kaage tried. But all she could say was “Kaa, kaa.” After a while, the koel had had enough. “You are impossible,” she declared. “You will have to find yourself another teacher.” And off she flew.Kaage was very disappointed. Crying bitter tears, she returned to her nest.Days passed. One day, Kaage watched as the sky filled with dark clouds. A cool breeze began to blow and it began to drizzle a little. From her nest, Kaage could see the peacock spread his beautiful tail feathers and begin to dance. She was filled with the urge to dance. 'Maybe the peacock can help, ' she thought to herself, and flew off to look for him.“Peacock, will you give me dance lessons?” asked Kaage, when she had found him. “Sure,” said the peacock. “Just do as I do.” Kaage spread her tail feathers. She stepped in time.“That isn’t right,” said the peacock. “Watch carefully when I do it.” Kaage tried again, and again, and again, but never got it right. The peacock was furious. “You will never learn to dance!” he scolded and flew away.Kaage was sad. She could not sing, and she could not dance. Maybe she could learn to build a wonderful nest. She went to the sparrow to ask for lessons. But the sparrow wouldn’t hear of it. “You? You will never be able to build a nest like mine,” she said, nose in the air, and sent Kaage away.Kaage felt very bad. When would she find something that she was good at? Looking down from her nest, she noticed that there was a pile of rice in the backyard of the house below. She began to caw loudly, inviting her family and friends to the feast. All of them ate until they were stuffed.It was then that a thought struck Kaage. All right, so she couldn't sing or dance or build a beautiful nest. But which other bird, when it found food, invited others to share it? Not the koel, not the peacock, and certainly not the sparrow. No bird, in fact, except other crows like her. Kaage was thrilled that she had discovered this for herself.She was proud that she was part of such a generous family. The other crows saw Kaage looking extremely happy with herself. “What is it, Kaage? Are you getting married soon?” they teased. Kaage blushed.Use your imagination and colour this picture any way YOU like.	./Story text files/364.txt	3588	13	5.848137535816619	292	57	127	43.30864197530864	52	29	27	9.074074074074074	39	42	205	144	5	1.2742718446601942	384	28
The sun had just dipped behind the coconut, mango and chiku trees that ring Appu’s house. The sky was still tinged with pink. The kitchen garden where the family grew brinjals, tomatoes and bottle gourd was still bathed in a soft light. Flocks of birds flew across the sky on their way home. Appu’s mother was making fish curry for dinner and wanted some fresh green chillies. Twelve year old Appu had gone to the garden to pick some fully grown, shiny green chillies when he was startled to hear a deep voice, “I am so glad your family likes my offerings.” Appu’s hair stood on end. He turned around to see who had sneaked up on him. The heavy but soothing voice seemed to come out of the kneehigh, leafy chilli plant. “Don’t be frightened, I am Ajar Uchu, known as the Spirit of Chillies,” it said.“You water the plants every evening and take care of them. I am so happy to be loved and admired. I am tens of thousands of miles away from home, and so your care means a lot to me.” Appu took a few moments to recover from the shock of hearing a voice from the plant. Appu asked, “Where do you come from?”“From very, very far, from the Americas. More precisely, from Mexico,” Ajar Uchu answered. Appu had no idea where Mexico was. Before he could ask for more details his mother shouted from the kitchen, “Appu, please bring the chillies in now.” Ajar Uchu said, “You have to go now, I suppose. Come back tomorrow and I’ll tell you more. But please don’t tell anybody about our conversation. I’ll tell you the story of our journey to India and all over the world.” Still dazed, Appu nodded and ran off. This little plant in the back garden came from faroff Mexico! “What took you so long?” Ma asked. Appu remembered what Ajar Uchu had said. “Oh. . . I spotted so many tomatoes that have grown on the plant since I last looked,” he said. He would learn later how the tomato plant too, had come from the same place as the chilli.Appu did not linger to taste the few pieces of fish that Ma had just fried. He ran off to his room and picked up the small globe that he had received on his last birthday. Impatiently, he turned the globe to see where South America was. It was on the other side of the globe. He quickly found the country that Ajar Uchu had mentioned: Mexico. Amazing! Appu thought. The next day seemed to drag for Appu. He went through his classes distractedly, finished his homework early in the evening with only one thought on his mind – the talking plant. Just before sunset he filled up the watering can and walked to the garden. He watered the egg plants, spinach, tomatoes and bottle gourd vines before coming to the chilli. Just after he had emptied the watering can on the chilli plants laden with bright green pods, some even turning red, Ajar Uchu spoke, “Ahh! So refreshing after a hot day! Thank you Appu.” Appu eagerly knelt down to listen to the story.“Thousands of years ago,” Ajar Uchu recounted, “Inca gods reigned over the vast mountains and forests that lay over South America. They sent four brothers to help the people who lived there. The Inca people grew maize, potato, avocado, tomato and many other fruits and vegetables.” Ajar Uchu was one of the brothers sent by the gods to ‘pepper up’ the life of the people. His spirit inhabits the chilli plants which became one of the most loved of the fruits. “Yes,” the voice told Appu, “chilli is actually a fruit, even though you may think of it as a vegetable. Although it is not sweet like other fruits, it produces seeds from which new chilli plants grow. That way the spirit of Ajar Uchu continues to live. Chilli became very popular as a condiment to spice up the region’s bland food of corn flour and potatoes. The kings demanded that Aztec and Inca people pay tribute with a supply of ripe and dried chillis.” “What is a tribute?” Appu asked. “It’s a kind of tax people pay to the king,” Ajar Uchu explained.Aztec and Inca Empire In what is now Mexico there was an older civilization created by the Aztecs. They spoke a common language – Nahuatl. Some  years ago they organized themselves into an empire. They had developed a rich agriculture growing corn, chilli pepper, avocado and other fruits. They also grew fine cotton to weave beautiful clothes and had plentiful gold to make jewelry. In the middle of a lake they built Tenochtitlan, their capital city. The Spaniards conquer the Aztec capital of TenochtitlanFurther south on the Andes mountains (today’s Peru) lived another people – the Incas – who worshiped the sun god, and believed one of his sons was Ajar Uchu. They built a large empire that eventually extended almost down to the southern end of South America. The powerful Inca kings collected tribute from the people in gold and produce like chillies, and as labour. The Incas did not know how to make wheels, yet they built ,  miles of roads! They carried heavy stones to build large monuments, rolling them on logs. Maybe they did not need wheels for carts as they had no horse or buffaloes to pull them – they had only goatlike llamas as pack animals. Aztec Maya Inca Map of AztecInca empire to the left. Map not to scale.“All this is interesting,” Appu interjected, “but how did you travel from your country to India?” On the globe, Appu had noticed the vast oceans and the African continent that separated India from Mexico. The voice said, “That’s a long story. The foreigners who came to our ancestral land and helped to take the chilli plant all over the world actually came there looking for a way to get to India. One day, over five hundred years ago, three sail ships sent by the King and Queen of Spain showed up in our neighborhood. Led by an Italian captain named Christopher Columbus, they had crossed the Atlantic Ocean hoping to find a shorter route to India. They had no idea that the huge American continents and the Pacific Ocean stood in the way.” “Why did they want to come to India?” Appu asked. Ajar Uchu chuckled, “Because India was the place that grew pepper, what you call kali mirch, and Europeans loved to season their food with it. Columbus, in fact, had brought some kali mirch with him to show people what he was looking for. He was convinced that he had reached India and he called Aztec, Inca and other local people he met Indians.”“Oh, that’s who the Red Indians are!” Appu exclaimed, surprised and pleased at his own discovery. “Columbus was very disappointed that those Indians had no black pepper to sell. But they showed him varieties of chilli that people grew. He tasted them and found they were as pungent as Indian pepper. He called that tiny fruit chilli pepper and stuffed his bags to take it back to Spain,” said Ajar Uchu. Appu was amused by the thought that Columbus came to look for kali mirch and took home hari mirch and lal mirch instead! Christopher Columbus meets the ‘Indians’!The next day Appu greeted Ajar Uchu after watering the plants. Appu was thrilled when he said, “Ah! I must tell you more about the Age of Discovery.” That sounded almost as exciting as a new computer game! Dimly a large map of the world began to take shape and the countries of Portugal and Spain and their ocean ports began to glow. “The Europeans’ love for Indian pepper,” Ajar Uchu explained, “goes back two thousand years. As early as the time of the Roman empire, wealthy people loved to spice their meat dishes with fragrant pepper. And they were willing to pay a high price for a few grams of the spice. Courageous Arab and Greek sailors set out for Kerala across the Arabian Sea to buy black pepper in exchange for other goods and gold coins and made a large profit reselling them to the rich people in Europe.”European Empires Europeans had long enjoyed spices imported from India by the Arabs. The Portuguese and Spaniards developed sea worthy boats and navigational tools that made it easier for them to sail the open ocean and they set out for India by going through the Atlantic. United Kingdom British Dominions France Portugal Spain Netherlands Belgium United States Map of the world’s empires in . Map not to scale.Christopher Columbus ended up in America () and Vasco da Gama in India (). They set up trading posts and then gradually colonized entire countries through power of arms and cunning. Greedy for territories rich in agricultural and mineral resources, the British, Dutch, Belgians, French, Danes and Italians also started carving up the world into colonies. To avoid conflict among Christian countries, the Pope even drew an imaginary line on the globe allowing Spain and Portugal to take control of land on either side of the line. The line was ignored when the British and Dutch joined the fray. Until India won independence in , India was the crown jewel of the British colonial empire. Christopher Columbus lands in the Caribbean island of San SalvadorThe Roman Empire From a small city state founded near today’s Italian capital, Rome, an empire grew through conquests and ruled a vast territory for nearly  years. The Roman empire had people of many ethnicities and languages as its citizens. One Roman emperor was even of African origin. Peaceful and organized civilian life was made possible by an elaborate legal system. The Roman Empire spread around the Mediterranean Sea,  CE. Map not to scale.The wealth created by taxes was used to maintain a large army and for luxuries for the ruling class. Many imported items like Chinese silks and Indian spices were most popular. Many imported items like Chinese silks and Indian spices were most popular. After the Roman Empire spread to today’s Egypt, trade with India blossomed. Large amounts of gold and silver coins were sent to India to buy spices. The importance of spices for a luxurious life can be seen by the silver pepper pots the Romans used to store precious pepper. A special spice market was built in Rome, and the city’s most fashionable street was named Pepper Street. Why were the Europeans crazy about pepper? The ordinary round grains of black pepper that people buy at the village grocer’s shop for a few rupees were sold for kilograms of gold. Why? “It was the rarity of the item,” said Ajar Uchu. Traders brought it from a very far and mysterious land. They traveled for months across the perilous ocean and then on camel caravan across vast deserts. Pepper not only made the food tastier, they found it also had medicinal value. Most importantly, pepper was the most precious commodity that you could use to show people how rich you were. Kings and aristocrats put small quantities in dainty little satin bags and gave them away as party favours. So, when Columbus promised the Spanish king that he would make him the ‘Lord of the Spices’, it meant he would be recognized as a very wealthy monarch.But with the rise of the large Islamic Ottoman Empire in eastern Mediterranean which controlled the trade routes to India, Europe’s pepper lovers were at a disadvantage. By the th century, shipbuilders had learned how to build sturdier ships which could take better advantage of wind on their sails. The knowledge of oceans too had grown. But still the vast body of water and what remained on the other side was a mystery. Silver pepper potsThe Ottoman Empire Inspired by Islam, a nomadic Turkic speaking people from Central Asia under the leadership Osman Bey, set out to conquer land from the non Muslims. His successor Mehmed II, led a victorious army to capture Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine empire in . In subsequent centuries, the Turkish Ottoman (the name emerged from the founder Osman) empire emerged as the biggest Islamic empire, covering territory from northern Mediterranean to Egypt and Yemen. The Ottoman capture of ConstantinopleAlthough devout Muslims, the Turkish sultans employed experts from different religions to build a strong economy. The Turkish army developed an elaborate marching band using bass drums, triangles and cymbals – instruments that were incorporated into Western classical music and even inspired Mozart. The Turkish army also unwittingly introduced Europeans to coffee when they left sacks of coffee bean while abandoning their siege of Vienna. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the Western classical music composerSeafaring, compass, boat building Europeans were compelled by the rise of the Ottoman empire to find a different route to India and by this time their knowledge about the ocean and navigation technology had grown. The Portuguese, who were pioneers in seafaring had developed better maps and astronomical knowledge enabling them to sail down Africa’s Atlantic coast. They hoped to make it to Kerala, the land of spices, across the Indian Ocean from the tip of Africa. Previously, Indians and Arabs made boats by sewing planks of teak with coir. Arab sailors discovered how to ‘tack’ against the wind using triangular lateen sails. Europeans also learned from the Chinese the use of the rudder to manoeuvre a boat. Astrolabe, a instrument that helped sailors to navigate on the high seasTo navigate without sun, moon or stars the Portuguese developed a fine mariner’s compass from a crude magnetic compass originally invented by the Chinese. Europeans also developed the astrolabe to more accurately gauge their position in the high seas. As they sailed, guided by the compass, they reeled out long ropes with knots at a specific distance to measure how far and fast they moved. That is why to this day, steam and dieselpowered boats still measure their voyages in knots rather than miles or kilometre.“Imagine going out with a torch on a dark night,” Ajar Uchu said. “When you switch on the light it shows you a few feet of the road and dimly lights whatever is on both sides. But beyond the narrow circle of light everything is dark and unknown. That is how the sailors felt when they set out on the open ocean. Over the years map makers stitched together such narrow views gathered by seamen to give a bigger picture.There were more areas marked as unknown than known. Apart from not knowing what lay ahead, sailing in the ocean was full of risks. In a storm, the waves were taller than a threestoreyed building and could easily swallow the ships. And they often did. Thousands of men drowned or were shipwrecked. And yet they never stopped trying to cross the seas to find what was on the other side. Why? There was no shortage of moneyed men either who would take the gamble of paying for such adventures. They hoped that the spices or gold or silver that the returning sailors brought with them, would bring them more money than they spent. The Europeans, especially Spaniards and Portuguese monarchs wanted to benefit from the lucrative trade by sailing directly to India. The Portuguese tried to go down south along the Atlantic coast of Africa and find a way to head east towards India. The attempt to find a route to the spices and riches of India led to dozens of shipwrecks and loss of thousands of lives. But in the end, these attempts brought the Portuguese sailor, Vasco da Gama, to India.” “You already know about a ship captain from the Italian city of Genoa, Christopher Columbus. He reasoned that since the earth was round if he journeyed west on the Atlantic pushed by seasonal winds he could reach Japan and India pretty quickly. Apart from the total ignorance of the land that lay on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, Columbus made a serious miscalculation which proved very fortunate. Columbus made a wrong calculation about the size of the earth,” Ajar Uchu said.“He thought it was much smaller than it actually is. If he had known the real distance between Europe and the Asian continent he might have given up the attempt. To be on the sea to cover a huge distance would not only require more food and water but also a larger crew and a much bigger ship. Columbus finally convinced the Spanish Queen, Isabella, that the journey to Asia across the Atlantic would be shorter than the route the Portuguese were trying. With her blessing and money, in the spring of  Columbus set out in a convoy of three small ships – Santa Maria, Nina and Pinta to an unknown destination. After several weeks of sailing south west on what seemed to be an endless ocean the crew was getting worried about food and water. Finally on a moonlit night, the sailor who kept watch from the top of the tall mast, cried, “Land, land!” In the morning grateful sailors landed on a territory that no Europeans had set foot on before.They were met by curious people wearing no clothes, speaking a language that nobody understood. This was San Salvador, a Caribbean island, but Columbus was certain he had reached India. He thought the people who met them at the shore were obviously Indians. “The one who actually reached India, six years after Columbus’s voyage,” Ajar Uchu continued, “was Vasco da Gama. He led a Portuguese fleet commissioned by the King of Portugal. Four vessels and  sailors under his command rounded the tip of Africa and their ten month long journey ended in Calicut. That was the right place to get pepper!” (Route of Vasco da Gama’s first voyage to India,  to . Map not to scale. )“Vasco da Gama asked King Zamorin of Calicut, ‘Will you let me take some pepper plants away to my country? ’ Zamorin smiled and said, ‘Yes, you can take some plants but you won’t be able take our sun and rain. ’ The Portuguese soon found out the truth of those words. Instead of importing pepper, the Portuguese settled in India, capturing Goa from a local ruler in . Goa was soon turned into a great trading post shipping tons of pepper to Europe. The King of Portugal and not that of Spain became the Lord of Spices.” “In a twist of fortune another Portuguese captain trying to reach India was blown off course by winds in the south Atlantic and landed in the eastern coast of South America. The land was called Brazil. The place was turned into a Portuguese colony and Brazil proved to be the source of many new food items that were introduced to India.While large sailing ships left Goa for Lisbon loaded with pepper, cloves, cinnamon and other spices, the Portuguese started bringing in to India a variety of new kinds of fruits, vegetables and animals from South America. Brazil not only had chilli and other new produce, the Spaniards found they also had new products like pineapple, cashew nut – called caju – and rubber trees. Soon the ships full of produce from Brazil left for the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, to be transferred to ships that left for their long journey to Goa. (Vasco da Gama reaches India)One of the names for chilli in Goa was ‘Pernambuco pepper’ after the Brazilian port from which the shipment of chilli arrived.” Ajar Uchu paused and then said dramatically, “Goa! That was the world’s gateway to India.” Goa glowed brightly and Appu closed his eyes as he imagined the bustle at the sea port with many ships and sailors in different outfits! “When chilli seeds arrived in Goa they were snapped up by traders,” laughed Ajar Uchu, seeing Appu’s face. “It added so much flavor and taste to the food that the hot chilli peppers were passed from hand to hand. They spread all over western India and were known a Govaimirchi. It did not take long for different varieties of chillies – long, round, fat and stubby and of different colors – to spread all over India and Sri Lanka. Since there was active sea trade between Bengal and Sri Lanka chilli might have reached there from Sri Lanka. Maybe that’s why the Bengalis call chilli lanka,” mused Ajar Uchu. “But did the chilli just stay in India? No, it traveled westwards! Traders took chilli to Central Asia and Turkey and to Hungary. In Hungary a new variety of chilli called paprika was developed. It became Hungary’s favorite cooking ingredient making Hungarian paprika famous.” “So, one of the earliest wild plants to be domesticated by humans in far away Mexico nearly ,  years ago became such a basic ingredient that a Spanish priest in the th century wrote, ‘Without chilli, Mexicans do not believe they are eating. ’ It spread to so many other parts of the world,” said Ajar Uchu.In this way, Goa became an exciting place of discovery! Every two weeks Emperor Jahangir sent an official from his court to Goa to check on any new product that might have arrived from the ‘New World’, as North and South America came to be known. On one visit the official brought back pineapples and a strangelooking bird – a turkey. Jahangir’s court painter was ordered to paint these strange items. At the order of the Emperor a special garden was set up in Agra to grow pineapples for the palace. The original Brazilian name for the pineapple was ananas and that is how it was known in Agra too. Potatoes which grew only in Peru in South America were also introduced to the Mughal kitchen. When the British ambassador, Sir Thomas Roe, was entertained to a banquet by the palace, the main dish was made of the new root vegetable – potato. The ambassador who had never tasted such a vegetable before, was charmed.In a country where a large number of people are vegetarian, the arrival of new produce like corn, tomato, okra, red beans, sweet potatoes, peanuts and avocado proved a great boon. Not only vegetables but a whole new range of fruits also made their appearance. Papaya, litchi, guava, custard apple, chiku or sapota (its original name in Mexico is Chicosapotee) added to India’s already rich and varied food basket. (Traders at a Goan port)“Foreigners must also have taken things that grew here,” reasoned Appu. “Of course,” said Ajar Uchu. “Europeans’ craze for Indian pepper initiated the search for new sea routes. And once they reached here the Portuguese found the irresistible mangoes and coconuts and planted them in Brazil. Now mango is a major summer fruit in Brazil and Mexico.”“But, long before the Portuguese landed here, India supplied another crop that made its way to the Caribbean Islands and South America and made them rich. That was sugarcane. Sugarcane was brought into India a long time ago from Southeast Asia and Indians developed ways of turning the cane juice into sugar. Chinese Buddhist monks who came to India in the seventh century were intrigued by what they called ‘sweet rock’. China’s powerful emperor Taizhong sent an embassy to the court of Emperor Harshavardhan requesting him to send craftsmen who could teach the Chinese how to make sugar. Along with some Buddhist monks, two sugar makers travelled to China to introduce sugarcane and sugar making. Sugar was one of the key items of Indian export to the Middle East. Arab traders took sugarcane and introduced it as a crop in the island of Cyprus in the Mediterranean. Europeans loved sugar so much that the Spaniards saw a great business opportunity. They forcibly took slaves from Africa and developed huge sugar plantations and exported sugar all over the world.” Appu was intrigued by the thought. “So we gave South America sugar in return for chilli!” he exclaimed. As the sun reddened the sky and Appu knew that Ma would call him soon, Ajar Uchu ended by saying, “You can see how our lives, and the food we eat are connected to the rest of the world. Foods travelled without passports! The world is tied together by the foods we eat.”Appu’s mind was racing back to the evening he first heard the voice of Ajar Uchu. Indeed in his own backyard they grew not only chilli and tomato but also chiku and papaya. Thanking Ajar Uchu for being his secret friend with the most amazing stories, Appu went straight to his room, took out a sheaf of paper and with his crayons he wrote in large letters ‘Vishwa bagicha’  the garden of the world. He took it down to show his mother saying that he wanted to hang that on the gate of the garden. Ma was surprised. “Why?” she asked. “It’s a long story. I’ll tell you tonight when Baba comes home,” smiled Appu.	./Story text files/47.txt	23814	22	6.0085227272727275	1940	524	274	87.86194029850746	61	207	45	16.582089552238806	48	220	1254	1210	6	1.6847345132743363	2222	490

"There was once a little girl who dreamt a lot. She dreamt of seas and forests, of fields and valleys, of mountains and rivers; she sometimes dreamt she flew high into the sky and at other times she saw herself diving into the ocean; but best of all, she dreamt of the school bell ringing to announce the end of the school day and of all the children running out with their bags in glee. Sometimes upon waking up, she would discover she was not at home under the blankets but had dozed off in class and the bell had really rung!Vijaya  that was the little girl's name  loved the lunch break and the end of school hours for then she could play with Ammu, her best friend, and talk ten to the dozen while cycling on their way back home. Viji, as she was called by her friends, loved to talk about her dreams to Ammu who would listen with wonder and wish she could have such amazing dreams too. Ammu was a patient listener and a warmhearted girl. She cried easily if the others bothered her but Viji was her protectress. The mean kids did not dare make Ammu cry when Viji was around because she would make her eyes very large and scary and glare at them. She would give those girls a good scolding in a stern, high voice that they feared would catch the attention of the teachers if it were allowed to continue. Viji loved looking after Ammu and together the two of them discussed the beautiful lands that they sometimes dreamt of and wondered where those places could be. Perhaps it was in America? Ammu had ventured. Viji didn't like the sound of America and said she would find out the name of the place from somebody when she dreamt next.One day, Viji didn't come to school and Ammu had to spend a whole day without anyone to talk to. She waited eagerly for her best friend to show up on the next day but Viji was absent again. This went on for the whole week. She found out that Viji's maternal grandmother was very sick in bed and that Viji and her parents had had to rush to her aid to her mother's village in Andhra Pradesh. When the weekend came, there was still no news of Viji. On Sunday night, Ammu prayed hard before going to bed that Vijaya should return to town and attend school the next day. She put in an additional prayer asking for her grandmother to be healed soon, recalling how much Viji loved her.That night, Ammu had a vivid dream. She saw that she was travelling though a dark forest with Viji. They were small and the trees were big and tall. As they walked, leaves fallen on the ground crumpled under their feet. At long last they came upon a bright green field at the end of the woods. The sun shone merrily on a cottage in the distance. She could spot a cow and two country fowls near it. Someone waved at them from within the fence. The two of them ran to greet her. It was an old woman, quite tall and healthy, with long graying hair tied in a plait behind her, a big beaming smile and deep, peaceful, beautiful eyes. She bowed down and scooped the two of them up, one on each arm and Viji screamed, ""Ammamma! "" It was her grandmother, whole and well. Of course she was pleased to see her!The next moment Ammu found herself being shaken firmly by her mother, trying to wake her up. ""What are you smiling at, my dear? "" she asked. ""If you sleep a moment longer you will be late for school today! Come on, we have to get you ready. "" Ammu was still half asleep. Her mother continued. ""Oh, and Vijaya's mother called up saying you are to take your cycle by their house today. Vijaya is going to school. They returned late last night with her grandmother. "" Ammu jumped up from her bed at this. All her drowsiness was gone. She knew it! Hadn't she just dreamt of it all? Wait till she could tell Viji all about it! This was going to be the best Monday of her life."	./Story text files/116.txt	3788	12	5.362924281984334	333	50	339	74.78	23	27	66	15.48	13	37	261	122	4	1.3636363636363635	382	36
"Raji was sitting peacefully under a tree, reading a book and eating a bajji, when a crow walked up to her. ""Hi Kaaka! "" Raji said.Raji opened her mouth to take a bite of bajji. The crow flew up, grabbed the bajji, and flew away.Raji jumped up, leapt over the compound wall and started running down the road. ""Give that back, you useless, foodstealing, peanutbrained crow! "" Raji shouted.The crow was flying slowly. Its body was getting bigger and heavier. Worse, its wings were getting smaller. ""I'll get you soon! "" Raji said.Salim came cycling down the road. The tired crow dropped from the sky and fell on Salim and his cycle: CRASH! Raji ran up to them.Salim was lying on the ground with his cycle. There was a weird creature on his head, flapping wildly. It was large and strong. And it had teeth. It bit Salim, hard. CHOMP! ""Aaaarghh! "" screamed Salim. ""Your crow is eating me! """"That’s not my crow, "" Raji said. ""Actually, it’s not a crow at all. "" They looked at the notcrow. ""You’re right. That’s a dinosaur! "" yelled Salim.The crowdinosaur flapped and ran towards the bazaar.

""We should stop it, "" Salim replied.The crowdinosaur stomped through the bazaar, yelling KAA KRAAAAA and knocking everyone over.Only Prof. Aunty watched it with wonder: ""Is that…? Am I losing my mind? Could it be a real live theropod? ""Raji and Salim helped Prof. Aunty up. ""Prof. Aunty, have you seen …? "" asked Raji and Salim. She said, ""A birddinosaur? Yes, I have. Where did you get that creature? "" she said. ""They’re supposed to be extinct! I've been studying them all my life and I've only seen old bones. ""The excrow headed out of the bazaar. Raji and Salim and Prof. Aunty followed. Raji ran extra fast and threw herself at it.""Got you! "" Raji held the crow dinosaur close. Salim sat down and said, ""It’s turning into a TRex!

""Yuck, gross, cannibal! "" shouted Raji. ""It’s like if I ate my cousins! "" said Salim. ""No, it isn’t, "" Prof. Aunty said. ""Birds are descended from dinosaurs. So they’re fairly close to crocodiles. But lizards are an entirely different kind of reptile. ""The crowdinosaur curled up on the ground and made an unhappy noise: Kraakroomp. ""I think it’s sad it can no longer fly, "" said Salim. Raji patted its snout kindly.They went to Prof. Aunty’s house. On the table was a plate of bajjis. ""Mmm, "" Raji said. ""Kraaa! "" said the dinosaur. It stretched as tall as Prof. Aunty, snatched the entire plate, crunched the bajjis and the steel.Then it made a loud BURP, and stuck all its teeth out in a huge, happy grin: Kaaaa! Raji and Salim exchanged a grin and said together, ""Kaakasaurus Rex! ""Birds are descended from a family of dinosaurs called theropods. They are often called ""living dinosaurs.

Mac lived in a house with a very small kitchen, where Mac loved to sleep on the cool floor. This caused lots of problems.Mrs Smith would come into the kitchen and ask, “Why have I got such a large dog in the middle of my very small kitchen?” Mac would see he wasn't wanted, and slink away to the hall where the floor was almost as cool, but the smells weren't as nice.Just when Mac had begun to settle down Baby Katia came crawling along the floor of the hall. She bumped into Mac, and let out a small squeal, ” EEEIKK. ” . Mrs Smith looked over and threw her hands up in the air again, saying, “Why have I got such a big dog in my small passage way?” Picking up the baby she chased Mac out of the hall.Mac looked up with droopy Mac eyes, and saw he was not wanted there either, and decided to slink away to the bathroom. In the shower the floor was always cool, sometimes a little damp, but always perfectly shaded for snoozing. Mac didn't like the soap smell, but he thought maybe at least I'll be safe here out of the way for a while.Right at that moment, Katia's big brother Tyron, who hated getting up too early in the morning, choose to get up and wandered down stairs to have a shower. When Tyron saw Mac in the shower he said to him, “Mac, I am happy for you to have a shower with me, but I don't think you are going to like it.” Mac looked up at Tyron with his big droopy Mac eyes, and rumbled a Mac rumble, ” GRMMRMRL.”Mac tried to decide if Tyron wanted him to go or stay. He paused in thought, half standing up and half lying down in the shower. Tyron said: “Mac if you don't believe me I can show you.” He turned the tap on very softly to let Mac know what might be coming.Mac suddenly felt something cold and wet, he looked at Tyron a bit startled. Then he realized Tyron was just warning him there was more coming and he wouldn't much like it, and perhaps he better go. So he ambled back to the hall – looked around to see if the 'coast was clear', and sunk down into his favorite snooze position.The coast was not clear for long, Mr Smith came back from reading his paper and saw Mac. “Mac, old boy, why do you, such a big dog, choose to sit in such a small passage?” he asked. “You know you shouldn't be here, Mrs Smith will find you and you don't want that do you?” Mac looked up with his big droopy Mac eyes, and rumbled softer this time. . . . “Grmmgrl.”Mac didn't know what to do now, it was hot outside, and the new puppy would be out there and want to play. Mac didn't want to play now, he wanted to sleep. The only place Mac could go for really good shade was on the balcony, but he was afraid of climbing up the stairs. The stairs were so BIG and STEEP and SCARY looking.He tried to slink back to the kitchen, but Mrs Smith spied him creeping in, “Mac, why do I have such a big dog trying to creep into my small kitchen again?” She threw her hands up again, for the third time that morning. “Mac what will I do with you?  Outside now!”It was getting closer to midday, and it was getting hotter by the second. Mac wished he didn't have a fur coat. There were lots of trees to lie under, but the ground was all prickly and Mac didn't like it. He looked at the stairs, he wanted to go up and lie under the table on the cool balcony floor, but they were terrifying. They were so big and steep, he didn't know how he would come down. Maybe he would get stuck up there, and if no one found him he might miss his dinner. Or maybe his legs would fall through the gaps and he would be trapped, Then the Cat would taunt and tease him until someone came to the rescue.While thinking of all the terrible things that might happen if he tried, he slowly ambled over to his least hated tree where he lay down in the prickly grass. Soon after he lay down to snooze, the new puppy came bounding up to him. “Whatchya doing Mac? Watchya doing?” “GrrrrrrMm” . Said Mac. “Whatchya doing Mac? Watchya doing? !” “GRRMMMLL” Said Mac, this time in a more menacing Growly voice. The puppy should know what that meant, he thought.But noooo. . . The puppy was young and very eager but not yet very bright, “Mac – watcha doing, don't ya wanna come and play with me?” She said, still waiting expectantly for a reply. Mac tried to ignore the puppy and rolled over to face the tree.“Mac, I'm gonna go chase the Cat – I saw him just now. Mac don't you wanna chase the Cat with me?” Mac put his paws over his head and pretended not to see or hear. She just ran up the stairs on to the balcony, if you wanna come with me, I think she's trapped up there.”Mac was going to roll over again when his ears pricked up as he caught the word 'Balcony'. “Little Dipper” , he said slowly in a bit of a mumble grumble, not wanting to sound too interested, ” Do you know how to get on to the balcony?”Little Dipper didn't quite understand what he said because he was mumbling, but was so surprised and glad that Big Mac was talking to her she was eager to give a good answer. ” Sure I do” , she replied. ” So how do you?” asked Mac. ” How do you what?” replied Little Dipper ” How do you get onto the balcony?” asked Mac. ” Well by the stairs of course” , replied Little Dipper.Mac shuddered a bit at the thought of the stairs, but tried not to let Dipper see. ” Well I know by the stairs, but how?” Mac asked. “Those stairs are awfully big, and you are so very small. And what if you can't get down again?” Mac inquired further. ” But I normally always get down – why shouldn't I?” replied Dipper. ” You always get down OK?” said Mac. ” Yep always” , said Dipper. “But how?” asked Mac.Dipper looked at Mac, she was only one and a half, turning two years old soon, but she had been climbing stairs ever since she could remember. She tried to think how she did it, but couldn't remember – she just did, and she found it difficult to understand why Mac was asking so many questions.Then she thought, maybe it's because he's never climbed the stairs. Dipper thought very hard, and very long, until she decided for sure she had never seen Mac climb the stairs. “Mac” , she said, ” do you want me to show you how I climb the stairs?” Mac, coughed a little, and mumbled, “ “Grmmbl, er, well I would. But just to make sure you don't hurt yourself or get stuck.” Then he added, “You better show me a few times, to make really sure.”Dipper agreed, and they walked off together for the first time since she could remember. Mac, pleased that Dipper would show him the stairs, and Dipper, pleased that Mac wanted to play with her at last.At the top of the stairs they settled down under the table on the cool balcony floor. The Cat was gone, but Mac and Dipper had both forgotten. They lounged down in their favourite snooze positions and dreamed of pleasant doggy things.The EndMORE BOOKS!

Her chosen career is as a professional pilot, she has worked in a variety of aviation capacities from instruction to airline flying, and is the author of several aviation text books. Danielle started writing children's books as a creative outlet from the stress of her 'day job' and as a break from the sometimes monotonous work required for her professional writing. She began with the Mac and Dipper series, aimed at  year olds, inspired by two of her own dogs. After having a child of her own, she suddenly found she had a muse, an eager resource for test reading, and, by benefit of her age, an honest critic all in one. It was fun and rewarding to write creative stories which matched her daughters learning curve. A series of 'junior' books aimed at   year old children followed. Encouraged by friends and family, and already familiar with the selfpublishing route through her nonfiction books, Danielle began publishing the books online so that others could enjoy them too. Because of her passion for children's literature and the role it plays in improved literacy standards, all of Danielle's own books are available for free download and may be used free of charge for noncommercial purposes.MORE BOOKS!

Londi was a dreaming girl. Up in the sky, she didn’t see clouds.Instead Londi saw flying geese, jumping fish, and fluffy sheep running home.One afternoon, Gogo came outside, looking tired. “Londi, stop dreaming!” she said. “It’s time to go and fetch the water.”Londi stood up and smiled at her feet. “Let’s go, feet! You know the way there!”Londi started walking to the tap. She hopped over the rocks.She crept past Mama Neli’s house.She dashed down the path. The line at the tap was long. “Oh no!” Londi said to her feet.“We’ll have to wait. Let’s stay in line. No dreaming away!”Ooh! Londi thought. But what’s that shining over there? I wonder who lost their shoe?Did it belong to a girl like me? Or something else…And what’s that under there? Cheep! Cheep!And what’s that big shadow? Uh oh, it’s Gogo! “Londi, your bucket nearly rolled away!” “Sorry, Gogo. I dreamed too far, again.”They filled up the bucket together. Londi watched the big sun sink into the hills. “Come let’s go, my dreaming girl,” said Gogo.“Look, Gogo! There’s a pink pig in the sky!” “Oh Londi… It’s just a cloud,” Gogo sighed. Londi took Gogo’s hand and they walked home together happily.	./Story text files/411.txt	1164	14	5.766423357664234	113	24	75	27.414634146341463	39	2	12	5.853658536585366	34	7	84	53	3	1.2634730538922156	160	7
Prem studied in class two. He went to the municipal school near his house. His teacher was always bubbling with new ideas.One day, she asked the children to find and fill an empty matchbox. “Fill the matchbox with as many different things as you can, over one week. The one who packs in the most number of different things will get a prize next week.”Prem liked the idea. At home, Prem tried to put his eraser and pencil sharpener in the matchbox. He managed to fit in only one. They were too big. This made him think. What are the things I can put in?While he was doing his homework, the lead from Prem's pencil broke and fell off. He put the piece in his matchbox. After sharpening his pencil, he put a small wood shaving in his matchbox. Prem started looking carefully for tiny things.He could smell the poha his mother was cooking. In the kitchen, he found a small mustard seed, a cumin seed, and a seed of a red chilli. He put them in along with a grain each of sugar, rice and wheat. He added grains of maize, millet, green gram and other pulses.The next day, he put in a small rubber band, a piece of wool, one strand of hair, and a piece of thread. Prem now kept looked for tiny, teenyweeny things. The next day, he added a rose thorn, a sunflower petal, a small twig, a tea leaf, a tamarind leaf and a small stone.There was still some space in the matchbox. So Prem put in a small piece of paper, a pin, a needle, a bead, a nail and a small button. The matchbox was still not full. On the last day of the week, Prem put in a lemon seed, an orange seed, and a pumpkin seed. Now the matchbox was packed. It couldn’t hold any more.At school, each child counted the number of things stuffed in his or her matchbox. Some children had collected fifty things. One child had managed to stuff over a hundred things.When it was Prem’s turn, he shook his matchbox in the air. There was not a sound because it was stuffed fully! When Prem emptied his matchbox, everyone was surprised.He had stuffed over a hundredandfifty little things in his matchbox! No one had come even close to him. So Prem won a new box of crayons!	./Story text files/477.txt	2118	15	5.726027397260274	179	40	116	53.333333333333336	20	19	25	11.256410256410257	13	26	131	88	5	1.3170731707317074	229	17
It was dark outside and I could not see much from my window. I had just moved that evening into a new house in the city of Pune, in India. There was a deafening cacophony emerging from the dark, as if hundreds of badly tuned radios were crackling away! It was only in the morning that the mystery began to be solved. There, below my balcony, was a small pond in an abandoned quarry. I realized it must be inhabited by many of the animals that woke up only at night!Over the next year, I watched the pond undergo incredible transformations through the seasons. In summer, the area looked like a dry, lifeless barren depression. But come monsoon and life burst out like an orchestra, waiting for the conductor to give the signal! The first raindrops on the thirsty land gave off a lovely earthy smell. But they also did what no magician could do, turning the brown earth into an oasis of green and blue.Within a few days, blades of reeds were glistening silver in the sun. Plants that had seemed forlorn and dead suddenly stood proud and tall. The chocolate brown rods of the typha plant swayed in the wind, as cottony flowers from nearby trees drifted everywhere.Other creatures too joined in nature’s dance. Brilliant blue kingfishers waited patiently on branches, suddenly swooping down to catch a fish with a splash. Baya weaver birds and scalybreasted munias picked on the reeds to carry off nesting material.On the slopes near the pond, a pair of lapwings scurried around. Were they protecting their ‘nest’, a small depression in the ground with eggs that looked just like the earth? I think so, because every time any person came anywhere near, they would burst into noisy flight with a high pitched call of ‘didyoudoit, didyoudoit’.In the water, I noticed some rocks glistening in the sun. But as my binoculars focused on them, I was shocked. They were turtles! And then I saw movement under the water: more flapshell turtles, swimming with only their head sticking out. Just a week back, the ground was barren. Where did the turtles come from? I learnt from a book that they slept under the ground during the dry summer, waiting for the pond to fill up again. In their honour I started calling it the Flapshell Pond!Several birds walked around the turtles, who peacefully ignored them. The whitebreasted waterhen walked with a deliberate gait, looking for food. A couple of pond herons skulked through the tall reeds, wary of possible danger from birds of prey. And as the monsoon progressed, a pair of spotbilled ducks would land on Flapshell Pond, hunt for snails and waterplants, then take off to other natural ‘restaurants’!At times the air was full of flying insects: brilliant red dragonflies, butterflies of various hues, and delicate damselflies visible only at a close distance. Insect and bird calls in the day created a different monsoon symphony than that of the night.I thought that such a small pond could not have any mammal, but was I mistaken! I would often see shy mongooses come to the edge of the water, and once an entire family with three babies!And where there were mongooses, could the snakes be far behind? Indeed I was lucky enough to see chequered keelbacks, pretty water snakes, swimming between the reeds.But what caused the deafening noise in the night? Frogs and toads in their hundreds, croaking and singing away to attract their mates! They were joined by crickets that seemed to have builtin loudspeakers, clinging to the reed blades. Listening carefully, I soon learnt to appreciate this symphony with its own rhythms.The nighttime symphony had occasional guest appearances: the spotted owlet, bobbing up and down comically as I shone my torch on it, and the Indian nightjar, aptly named for its rather harsh ‘chukchukchrrrrr’ continuing almost through the night.One day I got the scare of my life! No, not from snakes, nor from herons with meanlooking beaks, but rather, from some people walking around Flapshell Pond, looking like they were surveying the area. I found out from my neighbours that they were planning to drain the wetland and make buildings on it! My heart sank. I could not let this happen. A friend and I mobilized the neighbourhood kids. We invited a couple of press reporters. The next day, the newspapers carried news of the children’s appeal. Other residents of the area also started calling up various officials to tell them to save the pond. Then a couple of environmental organizations joined in. We invited the city commissioner too. At first, he was not convinced, but when he experienced the monsoon magic, he realized it would be a shame to destroy the pond.Finally, all this did the trick. Flapshell Pond was declared offlimits to any construction! How lucky I was to have experienced monsoon’s magic!Here was a minisanctuary in the middle of a bustling city, with its multiple symphonies. Here, nature’s dance could continue, providing life to thousands of creatures big and small. Sometimes, magic is found in one’s own backyard!Save a Pond! Do you have a pond near your house? Have you observed the diversity of life in and around it? Is it threatened by construction or pollution? If it is, can you get together with your friends and parents and their friends, and tell everyone that you want it saved? And if people who want to build on it ask why you want it saved? A simple answer: because birds and insects and other animals also need a home to stay in!Would it not be wonderful if there were thousands of such city ponds, with wildlife of all kinds? You could join children and adults in various parts of the world, through your computer networks or even snail mail, sharing photos and stories of what you see there, and how you managed to save them!	./Story text files/342.txt	5732	17	6.533962264150944	377	153	244	79.74647887323944	17	54	38	14.859154929577464	11	60	290	240	5	1.6758620689655173	467	113
"“Achoo!” went Monkey. She had a terrible cold. “That was loud. I almost fell off the tree,” said Koel, poking his head through the leaves.“Really?” asked Monkey. “If this is loud, how loud do you think an elephant’s sneeze would be?” “I can only guess,” said Koel. “Maybe as loud as this… . . . Aachoo!”“That’s not loud enough!” said Porcupine. “An elephant’s sneeze is much louder than that!” “AchOO!” He blew out his little cheeks and his pointy nose quivered.“Grunt, grunt,” said Wild Boar. “That’s not loud enough. An elephant’s sneeze must be huge!”And taking a deep breath, she went, “AAchOO, grunt, grunt.”“What’s all this noise?” asked Deer. “Do you know how loud an elephant’s sneeze is?” asked Monkey. “I always sneeze politely,” said Deer with a sniff. “But an elephant must have a huge, disgusting sneeze, like this!. . . AAACHoo! . . . AAACHoo! Excuse me.”“AAACHoo!”All the animals jumped. Wild Buffalo joined the group. “That’s an elephant’s sneeze,” he said proudly. Deer, Wild Boar, Porcupine, Koel and Monkey looked at him with admiration.“Not bad, but not quite!” purred a low voice. Wild Buffalo’s nose quivered. Tiger leaped out from behind the bushes. She threw her head back, opened her mouth wide and gave the loudest sneeze you could ever imagine.She went, “AAACHOO!”Elephant walked into the clearing. “Pardon me,” he said to Tiger, “Do you have a cold too? I have one and I am going to sneeze.”“What?” roared Tiger. “What?” bellowed Wild Buffalo. “What?” barked Deer. “What?” grunted Wild Boar. “What?” squealed Porcupine. “What?” sang Koel. 'Oh wow! ' thought Monkey.“Ah. . . aah. . . AAH. . .” went Elephant. The whole forest waited. ‘Here it comes, ’ thought Monkey.“Aah. . . aaah. . . aaah. . . aaah. . . aaaaah. . . Aah. . . AAH. . . """"…hrrmmp!”“That felt good!” said Elephant. “Nothing like a sneeze to clear out the trunk.” Then he looked around and wondered, ‘Where have all the others gone? ’Koel began to laugh. “Now do you know how big an elephant’s sneeze is?” he asked Monkey. “Yes,” said Monkey “but. . .” “Not another question!” wailed Koel and flew hurriedly away."	./Story text files/548.txt	2105	18	5.569288389513108	221	46	98	17.803571428571427	102	10	19	4.223214285714286	97	15	133	134	4	1.0513513513513513	342	28

She just fries them and they puff. Amazing! Aditi and Aarav decide to observe, ask questions and find answers the next time pooris are made at home.Pa has put some wholewheat flour in a big dish. He adds a little oil and some salt and starts mixing water into the flour. How come the flour is absorbing the water readily? Well, the reason is, something in the wheat flour is very thirsty! When you are thirsty what do you do? You drink water. Gliadin and Glutenin are the two types of proteins in the wheat. Proteins and all other chemical substances are made up of tiny units called molecules. The molecules in these proteins are very thirsty. As soon as water is put in the flour, these molecules drink it. Then they become big and fat. They expand. Naturally, they don’t have enough space to sit comfortably. So they touch and push each other. They actually stick to each other.Sometimes, you hold each other’s hand and make a chain while playing. The whole chain then moves about. Similarly, these molecules stick together and form a network.Pa has made dough out of the flour. He asks Ma to knead the dough some more. She smears some oil on her palm and starts kneading. You need strong hands to knead the dough. She says if the dough is not kneaded the pooris won’t puff. How are these two related? Here is the secret. When you knead the dough, the molecules that are stuck to each other, now start stretching. When this stretching is complete, a new protein is formed. It is called Gluten. Gluten is elastic like a rubber band and we can give any shape to that dough. Ma has left the dough aside for some time. She is now preparing the kheer. Aditi and Aarav decide to come back when she starts rolling the pooris.Now Ma and Pa are ready. Ma has poured oil in the frying pan and has put it on the stove. She pinches off a small amount of dough, and rolls it into a poori. Pa slides the poori into the hot oil. In minutes, the poori has puffed. How did that happen?Here is what happens to the poori. The rolling is possible due to the Gluten in the dough. When the small piece of dough is rolled, a Gluten sheet is formed in the poori. When the poori is put in the hot oil, its lower surface becomes very hot due to the oil. Do you remember that water was used for making the dough? So, due to the high temperature, the water in the poori turns into steam. This steam is very powerful and it lifts up the sheet of Gluten. And that is why the poori puffs. Pa now turns the poori so that the other surface also turns golden. He has taken the poori out of the pan and kept it in a dish.Now with the help of a fork let us make a hole in a poori. See the steam oozing out? So the puffed poori doesn’t contain air. It has steam in it, right?Why are the pooris used for bhelpoori, aloo– dahipoori not puffed? There could be three reasons: if the poori is rolled very thin the steam formed is not sufficient for the pressure to build up so that the poori can puff. Sometimes after the pooris are rolled, thin holes are made in them with a fork so that while frying, whatever steam is created, it comes out of the holes and does not let the poori puff. Such flat pooris can be used for longer. Also if pooris are fried at low temperatures, steam forms very slowly, pressure does not build up and the poori does not puff. Now you know why some pooris puff up, and why some pooris don't!Experiment to get gluten from wheat flour Make dough using wheat flour and water. Use only adequate amount of water so that the dough would not be too hard or too soft. Use the lower portion of the palm and knead the dough for few minutes. If necessary, little oil can be used so that the dough does not stick to your palm. Leave the dough covered for about ten minutes. Now take a big bowl and put the dough in it after kneading it for few minutes again.Pour water on the dough in the bowl so that it is completely immersed in water. Continue kneading the dough in water till the water becomes white. Throw the water out and put fresh water in the bowl. Repeat the procedure till you observe that a small portion of the dough now remains which when kneaded water does not turn white. This means all the starch from the dough is removed and only gluten has remained. This is because starch dissolves in water but gluten does not. Take out the small portion of the dough which is gluten. You can stretch it like a rubber band. If you stretch it and leave it comes back to original state. This demonstrates the elasticity in it. You can spread it horizontally. This demonstrates the plasticity in it.Poori facts from history According to scientists, wild wheat originated first in middle east countries about ,  years ago. According to the world’s first encyclopedia ‘Abhilashitarth chintamani’ or Manasollas written in th century by King Someshwar, something similar to poori was made at that time but was called as pahalika. So poori is at least  years old. Excavation done near Damaskas in Syria revealed wheat dated back  years. Tools necessary for planting and harvesting wheat plants and also for grinding wheat were found at the same sight.CAN YOU FIND OUT? Can pooris be made from jowar, bajra or rice flour? Why? Apart from pooris, what are the other things we make using wheat flour? What happens if you put too much water in the flour? What happens when you use other methods of cooking flour such as in a tandoor or on a tawa?	./Story text files/138.txt	6066	16	5.773809523809524	483	105	203	55.700934579439256	50	57	37	11.551401869158878	37	70	261	327	5	1.4577777777777778	591	84
"Papa took Pattu’s report card from Ms Anuradha like it was a big box of sweets – with a big smile to match.Last time, Pattu had made a paper plane out of his report card. He said he sent it flying home – it never got there. Wonder why?Maybe the sparrow in the tree could tell you what a warm nest it made. Or the peanut seller could tell you what a nice cone it made.So this time, Papa went with Pattu to get his report card from the teacher himself. Papa looked at Pattu’s report card. His smile went from a slice of papaya to the thin wedge of a lime. out of  for Reading. Papa’s eyebrows dashed together like colliding bulls.  out of  for Recitation. He shook his head from side to side, like a tree in a storm.  out of  for Spelling. He let out a long whoosh, which sounded like a train engine.As they walked home, Papa thought, “This report card needs to be made not into a paper plane, but into a rocket and launched far, far away. What will Pattu’s Mummy say? She always used to come first in her class.”Just then, Pattu’s friend Shambavi came running and gave Pattu a toffee. “This is for sharing your pencils with me yesterday, when I forgot to bring one,” said Shambavi. “No wonder Pattu comes home with no pencils,” thought Papa.On the way home, a bunch of dogs ran alongside them, wagging their tails happily. Pattu bent down and patted their heads. “I. . . er. . . I give Kalu, Chintu and Bintu a few puris from my lunchbox,” he said. “And your mummy is so happy you are asking for extra puris,” thought Papa, “If only she knew where they disappeared!”Pattu and Papa were almost home, when their neighbour Das Uncle called out from his garden, ""Hello Pattu, I don’t need medicines today. "" Papa wondered, “We don’t need medicines as well. Why is he talking about medicines?” Das Uncle said, “I ask your son to buy medicines from the corner shop for me. He always brings back exact change. You must be proud of him.”At home, Mummy came out and asked, “How is Pattu’s report card?” Papa closed his eyes, and said, “It was a big, big shock!” Pattu’s face was as small as a crushed grape.“ out of  for sharing,” said Papa. “ out of  for kindness.  out of  for respect.”Pattu’s face was like an orange and Mummy’s like a watermelon – both bright and full of joy.Mummy sat down with Pattu. “This is my real report card,” Pattu said. Mummy smiled. “ out of  for honesty. No one could get a better report card.”"	./Story text files/136.txt	2416	18	5.3610108303249095	243	34	138	47.34	27	23	27	10.24	24	26	175	102	4	1.3140243902439024	311	17
Pishi was feeling sad and lonely. Just a day ago, he was one of a group of manta rays. They were feasting on tonnes of fish, far from the coast of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.How they had splashed and jumped out of the waters of the beautiful Indian Ocean! When he saw a ship ahead, Pishi had taken a huge dive in the water. His friends scattered. Pishi flapped his huge cloaklike fins and tried to swim to safety.There was a huge streak of lightning and a sound of thunder next. Pishi lost his bearings. The ocean had gone dark for him. A big wave rolled up, pushing him directly under the ship. Aaah, a cut on his belly!He knew what he had to do. He had to find his friends. But first he needed his wound to be treated. He swam and glided as fast as he could towards the coast.Pishi’s heart beat fast. He wished he was not so big –  metres long, and weighing over  kilograms! He had to get to a hospital. Fast! His life depended on it.Then he saw the lighthouse on the coast. He leapt with joy! Pishi had reached the hospital, nature's hospital.A huge school of fish swam around him immediately. The same fish that he ate at other times were now his nurses. They cleaned the deep gash in his tummy.The ‘cleaner fish’ nibbled on the torn pieces of skin. Soon Pishi felt so much better. He loved the Indian Ocean with its ,  species of marine life!Dear Reader, The Indian Ocean is known as ‘Ratnakara’ in ancient Sanskrit literature. Ratnakara means the mine of jewels. Manta rays often visit cleaning stations. A cleaning station can be called nature’s hospital in the ocean. Here, small fish such as angelfish swim in the manta ray’s gills and over its skin. They are called cleaner fish because, they clean the manta ray by eating up parasites and dead tissue. Even though manta rays are huge, they are quite gentle. They are hunted by many animals like big sharks, whales and humans.	./Story text files/244.txt	1891	13	5.801020408163265	158	38	102	47.51282051282051	20	19	19	9.974358974358974	18	21	109	87	5	1.4385964912280702	205	23

Young Dhyan Singh simply loved hockey. As a boy, he and his friends used to cut branches off date palm trees and use them as hockey sticks. Not many know that he actually played for the Army long before he joined the Army. At , he accompanied his father to a match between two Army teams. When one team fell behind in the game, Dhyan told his father loudly that if he only had a hockey stick, he would take them to victory.A British army officer sitting nearby scolded Dhyan for boasting, but then gave him a chance to play. True to his word, Dhyan scored four goals. So impressed was the officer that he inducted Dhyan into the ‘Bachaa Paltan’ or the ‘Children’s Platoon’. The story goes that Dhyan liked to practise the game after his daily soldierly duties were done. But of course, it was usually dark then, and this was many years before the coming of floodlights. So Dhyan used to wait to practice till the moon had risen. On full moon nights, when dogs everywhere howl and the trees are bathed in a silvery glow, you might have seen this slim young man with his flashing hockey stick, propelling a ball rapidly across a playing field before slamming it into the goal.And because Dhyan would wait for the moon, his mates in the Army called him Chand, and the name stuck. Dhyan Chandhe was, polishing his skills in the moonlight. All that hard work paid off for Dhyan. People said he often practised on railway lines, not letting the ball fall off the rail as he ran. That’s probably why Dhyan made a name for himself for his superb ball control in real games; after all, he had learned it the hard way, on the tracks.Time and time again during a game, he would run the whole length of the field, opponents sprawling in his wake, ball stuck like glue to his hockey stick until he sent it smoothly past a helpless goalkeeper into the net. The great runner Milkha Singh once asked Dhyan how he had become so good at his game. Dhyan said he used to hang an empty tyre from the goal, and then hit hundreds of shots every day through the tyre. Dhyan scored heavily, and in the years ahead, he would win plenty of games and medals for India. But what really became his trademark was this incredible skill with his hockey stick, this ability to control the ball as if there was nobody else on the field. As if he was alone again, practising under the full moon. But his stick skills alone would not have made Dhyan a champion. In the team game that hockey is, Dhyan was also the perfect team man. As he ran up the field, in his mind it was like a chessboard. You know how in your classroom, you can tell just where each of your friends sit? You can point them out, often even without looking: “Kavya’s there. Romil’s over there.” That’s what hockey was like for Dhyan. Without looking, he knew exactly where his teammates were, and to which of them he could pass the ball. And those pinpoint passes only made him seem like even more of a magician. Long after he retired, he once explained his beautiful game: “The secret is both my hands, and also my mind and fitness routine.”Talent is one thing, Dhyan meant to say with those words, and he knew he was blessed with hands wonderfully talented for hockey. But like all great sports stars, he also knew that what makes your talent count is the hard work you put in. To play as splendidly for as long as he did, he had to keep his body fit, his mind sharp. Dhyan’s father, Sameshwar Dutt Singh, served in the British Indian Army and played hockey as well.His eldest son, Dhyan, was born in Allahabad in . From a young age, people said of him, he loved the milk sweet ‘rabri’. His mother made the creamy delight for him whenever she got a chance. Did that explain the supple wrists, the thighs like steel springs, that served him so well while playing hockey later in life? Maybe. But like all fond mothers do, she simply fed her growing son well, with no thought of what he might later become.Transferred here and there throughout his career in the Army, Sameshwar Dutt could never ensure a steady education for his children. Only when the Government gave Sameshwar some land to build a house in Jhansi was he able to settle down. But by then, Dhyan had already dropped out of school, after just six years. But though Dhyan wasn’t in school in Jhansi, he took to his father’s game with a passion. By the time he himself officially joined the Army at , Dhyan was already a fine player.By the mids, he was a rising star in Indian hockey. He toured New Zealand with an Army team in those years, helping them win  of their  games. Naturally, he was selected to the Indian team for the  Amsterdam Olympics. The team actually lost their last practice game – Dhyan scored their two goals, but their Bombay opponents replied with three – before leaving for Europe. The loss only spurred them on. They won practice games in England and Europe by such huge margins that when the Games began in midMay, the other teams must have been terrified of this Indian juggernaut.In Amsterdam, India thrashed Austria, Belgium, Denmark and Switzerland. In the final on May , India hammered the Netherlands. Dhyan and his team had sailed through the Olympics without giving up even one goal. Of their  goals, Dhyan scored . A local newspaper put it like this: “This is not a game of hockey, but magic. Dhyan Chand is in fact the magician of hockey.” And everyone who had ever seen the ball stick like glue to Dhyan’s flashing stick knew just what those words meant.India had won the Olympic gold medal in hockey. And the best hockey player in the world, already, was this  yearold Indian wizard. Only three teams played hockey at the  Olympics, in Los Angeles. India beat Japan and the USA, winning gold again.Dhyan’s younger brother Roop was also in the team by then, and together, the remarkable brothers scored  of India’s  goals. This Indian team, an American journalist wrote, was “a typhoon out of the East” . And the storm was just getting started. In their triumphant international tour of , the Indian team played  games and scored  goals. Dhyan fired home  of those. In , it was  games for  goals, Dhyan .And then came the  Berlin Olympics. Germany was then in the early years of Nazi rule, under Adolf Hitler. Hitler believed that Germans were superior in every way to the rest of the world. In the years to come, he would translate that belief into some of the most horrible slaughter mankind has ever known. But in , Hitler saw the Berlin Olympics as his first great chance to show off his twisted ideas to his country and the world.But Hitler’s plan didn’t work very well, and that’s partly because of Dhyan and the Indian hockey team. For the typhoon out of the East hadn’t slowed at all. India brushed aside Hungary, the USA, Japan and France to reach the final. Never mind, thought Hitler, Germany had also reached the final and would show these little brown upstarts from the East their place. And Germany actually scored a goal in the final, which was one goal more than those other four countries, combined, had managed against India. Trouble was, India scored eight. What must Adolf Hitler have thought? What did this debacle do for his notions of German supremacy? Another Olympic gold for India. Many more goals for Dhyan. He was a superstar now, the Roger Federer or Rahul Dravid of his time, celebrated in India and known wherever hockey was played. Yet with all those years of brilliance around the world, Dhyan himself considered his best match to be the final of the  Beighton Cup, an Indian tournament. Playing for his hometown Jhansi Heroes, he sent a long pass to a teammate, Ismail. As Dhyan later said, Ismail “ran with Jesse Owens’ speed half the length of the ground” and then scored the only goal of the match.Always, what mattered most to Dhyan was teamwork. And perhaps his mention of Owens — the great runner whose Berlin medals also proved how twisted Hitler’s ideas were — is an indication of how much the Olympics meant to Dhyan.Dhyan retired from the Army in , as a Major. That year, India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan award. He was then appointed Chief Hockey Coach at the National Institute of Sports in Patiala. He coached there and at various camps around the country for many years. He was delighted that his son Ashok Kumar carried on the family’s tradition of playing hockey.A worldclass hockey player himself who had inherited some of his father’s dazzling skills, Ashok scored the goal that won India the World Cup in . Sadly, by then India was already in decline as a hockey power; that World Cup was almost the last major world title India ever won. The retired Major, with his many memories of glorious hockey triumphs, never came to terms with how India was now struggling to compete with the world in the game he so loved. When India finished a dismal sixth at the  Montreal Olympics, Dhyan lamented, “Kabhi nahin socha tha aisa din dekhna padega,” (I never thought I’d have to see such a day).Dhyan Chand spent his last years in his beloved Jhansi. Residents would often see the great man about town, going to the market or visiting friends or running errands on a sturdy bicycle. He died in hospital in New Delhi on December , . He was cremated, with full military honours, at the Jhansi Heroes ground.Today, we celebrate his birthday, August , as our National Sports Day, and India’s highest award for lifetime achievement in sports, the Dhyan Chand Award, is named after him. If ever India becomes a powerhouse in sports, we can say we owe it to the inspiration of this man. This magician, who once played hockey that thrilled the world. This legend, born under an Indian full moon.Dhyan Chand’s India at the Olympics  Olympics in Amsterdam, The Netherlands IndiaAustria:  IndiaBelgium:  IndiaDenmark:  IndiaSwitzerland:  IndiaNetherlands:   Olympics in Los Angeles, United States of America IndiaJapan:  IndiaUSA:   Olympics, Berlin, Germany IndiaHungary:  IndiaUSA:  IndiaJapan:  IndiaFrance: 	./Story text files/175.txt	9986	18	5.893385982230997	819	194	313	89.7909090909091	24	86	47	17.381818181818183	14	96	489	524	5	1.5167548500881833	985	149

"Long long ago people didn't know anything. They didn't know how to plant crops, or how to weave cloth, or how to make iron tools. The god Nyame up in the sky had all the wisdom of the world. He kept it safe in a clay pot.One day, Nyame decided that he would give the pot of wisdom to Anansi. Every time Anansi looked in the clay pot, he learned something new. It was so exciting!Greedy Anansi thought, ""I'll keep the pot safe at the top of a tall tree. Then I can have it all to myself! "" He spun a long thread, wound it round the clay pot, and tied it to his stomach. He began to climb the tree. But it was hard climbing the tree with the pot bumping him in the knees all the time.All the time Anansi's young son had been standing at the bottom of the tree watching. He said, ""Wouldn't it be easier to climb if you tied the pot to your back instead? "" Anansi tried tying the clay pot full of wisdom to his back, and it really was a lot easier.In no time he reached the top of the tree. But then he stopped and thought, ""I'm supposed to be the one with all the wisdom, and here my son was cleverer than me! "" Anansi was so angry about this that he threw the clay pot down out of the tree.It smashed into pieces on the ground. The wisdom was free for everyone to share. And that is how people learned to farm, to weave cloth, to make iron tools, and all the other things that people know how to do."	./Story text files/173.txt	1397	15	5.22463768115942	121	17	128	62.54545454545455	9	13	27	13.818181818181818	5	17	88	50	3	1.261437908496732	139	14

A poor woman had a son. She worked hard as a gardener in wealthy houses in their town. They gave her some grain in return. But she felt bad because she could never afford to buy nice clothes or lovely toys for her son. The little lad was bright and cheerful. Not having any toys or nice clothes did not bother him. After a hard day's work, the mother was going to the market to sell the grain she had received. She asked her son: Mother: What can I get for you from the market, little one? Now the boy was fascinated with the sound of a drum. So he said: Boy: A drum, mother, I would love to have a drum to play with.The mother knew she would never have enough money to buy a drum for her son. She went to the market, sold her grain and bought some gram flour and some salt. While returning home, she felt sad that she would have to face him emptyhanded. So when she saw a nice piece of wood on the road, she picked it up and brought it home. The son did not know what to do with the piece of wood. Yet he happily carried it with him when he went out to play.A happy song sprang to his lips and he went along singing it: Boy: Tumtitee TumtiteeTumtiteeTumtitee Tumtitee Tumtitee Tot Tumtitee Tumtitee TumtiteeTumtitee Tumtitee Tumtitee Tot! I asked for a drum and look what I got, A lovely piece of wood! I asked for a drum and look what I got, I think my luck is good! Tumtitee TumtiteeTumtiteeTumtitee Tumti tee Tumtitee Tot Tumtitee TumtiteeTumtiteeTumtitee Tumti tee Tumtitee Tot!And as he went skipping along on his way, he came across an old man. The old man was trying to light his stove using some cowdung cakes. The fire was not catching and there was smoke all around. The smoke made the man's eyes water and he was coughing. The little boy ran up to him and said: Boy: What is the matter Grandpa? Can I help you in any way? Old Man: Ah! Little one, I am trying to cook some food, but I am unable to start a fire. For you see, My fire will just not start I need to cook. Oh! Take a look My fire will never start! Can somebody start this fire? My eyes are red, my arms are tired. I need to eat, I need some food. Oh! For a dry piece of wood!Boy: Here, Grandpa, you can use my piece of wood to start your fire. Narrator: The old man was very pleased. He lit his fire, made some bread and gave a piece to the boy. The boy skipped along singing his song: Boy: Lalalala Lalalala Lalalala La Lalalala Lalalala Lalalala La! My piece of wood got me some food. A lovely piece of bread. My piece of wood is not a drum, but it Got me bread. A lovely piece of bread. Lalalala Lalalala Lalalala La Lalalala Lalalala Lalalala La!The boy walked on till he came upon a potter’s wife. She had her baby in her arms. The baby was wailing and flailing her arms. The boy said: Boy: Dear lady, why is your daughter crying? Potter’s Wife: My little one is hungry. She has not had anything to eat since morning. I cannot give her anything as there is nothing in the house. I wish I had some bread to give her. The kind hearted boy gave the lady his bread. She gave the bread to her child who ate it eagerly and stopped crying. She was so pleased with the boy that she gave him a large pot.The boy went along humming his funny song: Boy: Tumtitee TumtiteeTumtiteeTumtitee Tumtitee Tumtitee Tot Tumtitee TumtiteeTumtiteeTumtitee Tumti tee Tumtitee Tot! I gave my bread away and Look what I got! I gave my bread away and Got a lovely pot! Tumtitee TumtiteeTumtiteeTumtitee Tumti tee Tumtitee Tot Tumtitee TumtiteeTumtiteeTumtitee Tumti tee Tumtitee Tot!The little boy skipped along until he came upon a strange scene at the river bank. A washerman was quarreling loudly with his wife. The boy stopped and asked: Boy: Dear Sir, what is the matter? Why are you quarreling with your wife? Narrator: The washerman said: Washerman: You see, son, it was like this, I gave her a pot, I gave her a pot. And what did she do? I gave her a pot, it cost a lot. She went and broke it too! I gave her the pot that cost a lot. It’ll cost me all the more. She broke the pot, the last of my lot, And now I feel so sore!I gave her the pot, the pot she broke. The pot I need to boil my clothes. Without the pot, my clothes will rot. Oh, they will remain soiled! So you see, I have nothing to boil my clothes in before I wash them. And because of her, my trade will suffer. Boy: Dear Sir, don’t quarrel with your wife. Please take this pot of mine and use it. The washerman was very happy with the pot. He was so pleased with the boy’s good nature that he gave him a nice coat in return. The boy ran along singing his funny song. Boy: As I walked along, With my pot in hand, I met a washerman. Who gave me this coat so grand! Oh so funny indeed! People looking for things, And I have what they need!The boy walked on, all the while admiring his grand coat. He soon came to a bridge, and there he was alarmed by what he saw. A man was shivering in the cold and he was not even wearing a shirt. He seemed to be hurt and was moaning in pain. The boy was very concerned and ran up to the man and said: Boy: You seem to be bleeding, You seem to be hurt! I'll try and get you some help. You also need a coat. The boy asked the man how he came to be in such a sorry state.The man said: Man: I was riding my horse in a hurry. I was riding my horse to the city. A crowd of thieves, they came and GOT me! They got me down, they got me out. They took my purse, got all my money. I tried to put up a good fight. But they beat me up, they beat me bad. They left me in pain, they left me hurt. They took it all, even my shirt! The boy said: Boy: Your need is greater than mine. Please take this coat. It will help you keep warm. The man was touched by the little lad's kindness. He thanked the boy profusely and presented him with the big fine horse he was riding.The boy was very happy and led the horse along, singing his song. Boy: Oh so funny indeed! People looking for things, And I have what they need! A man needs a shirt, But all he has is a big fine horse! I gave him my coat, what did I get? His big fine horse, of course! As he was walking along with his horse, he came upon a large party of gaily dressed people. They were part of a big wedding party with the bridegroom, and musicians. They seemed ready to go in a wedding procession, but all of them were sitting under a tree with long faces. The boy stopped and asked them what made them look so depressed.The groom’s father said: Groom’s father: You see, son, it’s like this. We are all set to go in the wedding procession. But we need a horse for the groom. The man who was supposed to bring it hasn’t turned up, the auspicious hour is almost gone. And the groom himself stepped up to the boy and said: Groom: I am the groom. Waiting to see my bride, But I’m stuck in here Just hoping for a ride! I just can’t go there on my feet. My horse is late and so is the hour. My guests are all waiting to eat. I’ll miss my wedding for sure! So you see, what I need right now is a horse! I need a horse! A really quick horse! Chorus: He needs a horse, he needs a horse! He needs a really fast horse!And so the boy, being helpful as ever, offered his horse to the groom. The groom was very happy and he asked the boy what he could give him in exchange for his horse. The boy looked around among the musicians and quickly spotted the drummer. He said: Boy: A stitch in time they say saves nine. And what indeed did save the day, Was this splendid horse of mine! All I want from you is That fine little drum that you play! Oh, make my dreams come true! Please make my dream come true! The groom requested the drummer to hand over the drum to the boy. The drummer knew he would easily get enough money to buy himself a brand new drum. He willingly gave his drum away.The boy rushed home singing his song and playing his new drum. He could not wait to tell his mother how she had helped him to get his drum. Boy: My piece of wood did a lot of good! It got me bread as food. My piece of bread lasted not, But gave me a lovely pot. My pot got me a lovely coat. The coat did help a needy man. I got me a big fine horse to ride. With that horse, I got a groom his bride! So you see it is simple indeed A little bit of give and take, Will a lot of people happy make! So when you meet your friends today, Try and make their day!	./Story text files/234.txt	8323	24	5.285057471264368	772	98	179	52.35897435897436	80	76	25	11.628205128205128	41	115	508	362	8	1.2617382617382618	937	64

Is it morning already? Why didn’t Ammi or Abbu wake me up? Did they forget I have school? Did they forget me? Where is everybody?“Noorain! You woke up by yourself!” Ammi says. I cosy up to her. Why is everyone so serious? And how come Ammi, Abbu, Dadu, and Nani are watching TV in the morning? “Ammi, is it Sunday?” I ask. Ammi is a science teacher, and we usually walk to school together. “No, Noorie, school is cancelled today,” she says. “Oh,” I say, acting as disappointed as I can. I’m secretly thrilled! “I guess I’ll just have to go to Wasim’s to play,” I say.Wasim and I are both in the second standard, but in different classes. We have been neighbours since we were babies. We have spent many holidays playing, swinging from apple trees and shouting over the rose bushes until our families yelled at us. We have even invented  games together! He is my best friend, and my best competitor.Abbu gives me some milk and chochwor bread. The bread is from Wasim’s family bakery. It has a special touch: raisins. I love it. “Noorie, no use going over to Wasim’s,” Abbu says. “He left for Jammu with his Ammi for a few days.”The news looks scary today. Nani raises the TV volume. Ammi, Abbu, Dadu and Nani have one of their silent talks. Ammi raises her eyebrows till they are question marks. Abbu shakes his head and sticks his lip out. Dadu spells out some letters softly: CURFEW. They all look worried.But why did Wasim go to Jammu? A few days ago, walking back from school, Wasim said we should both learn to ride the bicycle: “Let’s learn in one month, and we can race to school. Okay?” Oh! Maybe Wasim went to Jammu to learn cycling from his cousin Rafiq. How was I to learn to cycle now? Just then, Abbu says he won’t be going to office. “There are more CRPF guards on the street today, so my editor said I could work from home,” Abbu says. Abbu is home? Then I shouldn’t waste a second! “Abbu! Can you teach me to ride the new bicycle please? … Please, Abbu!”Abbu looks at me and says, “Of course, Noorie. But eat your breakfast first.” I chomp on it fast! O great milk and chochwor bread! Do your magic. Make me strong! Make me strong for Mission Cycle!Mission Cycle: Day  The cycle is my Eid present from Abbu and Ammi! I clean it till it shines bright. Tring Tring! I love the shrill bell. “Abbbuuuuuuuuuu!” Nani says, “Noorie! Why are you shouting? Abbu has just walked out to see how things are!” “But Abbu promised he would teach me to ride the cycle!” Nani puts her garden tools aside. “Oh, cycle? I can teach you,” she says. “But Nani, do you even know how to ride a bicycle?” I ask. “I was the fastest cyclist in my entire school, Noorie, my girl. Now, put your feet on the pedals, look straight at that wall, and start pedalling.”I look at the wall in front of me, focusing on that one peach on the tree. Focus. . . Focus. . . Focus! Where is Nani? As I turn to look back, THADAAAM!I did not see that wall at all. Nani comes running, “Noorie, are you hurt?” I check. I am not. But I still feel like crying. “Cycling is hard, Nani.” “Nonsense,” says Nani. She plants a kiss on my forehead. “The first thing you have to remember about cycling is to keep looking ahead. The second thing, is that falling is okay. It’s how you learn.” I get back on my cycle.Day  “On your mark…. Get set… Go!”Day  After cycling practice, Nani and I pick apples. I steal a look at the street outside – there are no people. “When your Abbu was your age, we had to stay indoors like this,” Nani says. Turns out, that was when she taught Ammi and Maasi to cycle. They fell all the time, and came running to her. “You are so brave, my Noorie. You will be a really good cyclist.” “Faster than Wasim?” I ask. “The fastest!”Day  “Naniiiiiiiii!” Oho! Nani is drying vegetables on the terrace for winter. Now who will help me ride the cycle? “Shall I teach you?” Dadu asks, from behind his newspaper. It’s so strange to see Dadu at home at this time. Strange, but amazing! “Dadu, aren’t you going for a walk with your friends?” “Can’t. There’s CURFEW. I might as well get some exercise running behind my granddaughter!” Yay! I prepare myself to look at the peach again, and try not to think of falling. But then Dadu makes a scary suggestion. He wants to remove the trainer wheels at the back of my cycle!Can I really ride on only two wheels? That is like being in a circus! When I say that to Dadu, he laughs his exploding laugh. “Everyone on the street does it, Noorie,” he says. “You just have to practise.” Using some tools, Dadu and I screw off the little wheels.Day  AAAAAH!Day  We are still not allowed to go out. “Is this gate getting taller?” I ask Ammi.Day  “Please! I’m bored at home! I want to go to school! Open the gate! Open it!” “I’m so sorry Noorie, how I wish I could take you out,” says Ammi. “How I wish you never knew these horrors.”Day  “Dadu, what is CURFEW?” I ask. Dadu looks uncomfortable. “It’s when the government tells us we should not go out, because it’s not safe on the streets,” he says. I miss going outside. I miss my friends, I even miss my teachers. “How long will we have to stay at home?” I ask. “I don’t know, Noorie,” Dadu says, with a sad sigh. Grownups usually don’t like to say I don’tknow, so this must be serious. I don’t like seeing Dadu sad, so I stand up. “Okay, enough rest! Come, I have to beat Wasim!”Day  It is Ammi’s turn to show me how to brake properly. We practise all afternoon. When Dadu and Nani came out at tea time, I am ready to show off. Just then, we hear a LOUD noise. Bang! Bang! People are yelling, “Hum kya chahte?” I know the next word: Azadi! My eyes burn. Ammi lifts me up and we run into the house.In the dining room, we sit close, in a tight circle. Everyone is coughing. “Ammi, what was that?” I ask. Ammi hugs me. “There are people fighting, Noorie.” She wipes my eyes. I realise they are watering! Hers are too. “When this happens, you hold your handkerchief against your nose and mouth okay?” Ammi says. I hug her close. I am tired, and scared. But everyone looks scared. I remember what Nani said on my first day of cycling. I have to be brave.Day  The next morning Abbu wakes me up. “Get up, lazybones. Today I am going to teach you!” “Is it safe, Abbu?” I ask. “I promise I’ll take care of you if anything happens, okay?” Abbu says. “Now, I hear Wasim is coming back in a few days. Don’t you want to be ready for the race?” As Abbu watches, I cycle just like Dadu, Nani and Ammi taught me. I learn how to turn! And make an “” without putting my feet on the ground.Just as I start getting bored cycling by myself, Wasim returns home. Finally! Abbu tells me the army lifted the CURFEW for a few hours, and Wasim’s Ammi quickly drove back to Srinagar. Wasim brings an armful of chochwor bread. I give him the peach I focused on during Mission Cycle. I am so happy to see that he is safe. “Go bring your cycle, Wasim,” I say. Wasim looks sad. “I left it out on the street, and my cycle got bent out of shape during the fighting.” Oh! Poor Wasim! How will we do Mission Cycle now? Wait! I HAVE AN IDEA!Mission Cycle: Final Day	./Story text files/412.txt	7091	19	5.538064516129032	655	120	148	33.59512195121951	158	47	30	7.590243902439024	133	72	423	352	5	1.235171696149844	911	50

It was a very special day and so Raza was wearing his best clothes. Today, he was going to meet someone very important – His Majesty Jalaluddin Akbar, the great Mughal king! Raza’s father Rahmat Khan was an important man too. He was the royal tailor to the king, and he stitched all his angarakhas – the loose coats that the king wore over his tight churidar pyjamas. This morning they were going to the palace in Fatehpur Sikri with the angarakhas the king had ordered for summer. The king was very fussy about his clothes and it was very hard to please him.Rahmat Khan had worked hard to make the angarakhas – cutting and stitching late into the night. Raza had helped too – putting in tiny stitches using the finest needle and the best silken thread. The spring sun shone brightly, the flowers smiled, and the pigeons cooed happily as the two of them walked to the fortress of Fatehpur Sikri. Two soldiers holding spears stood guarding the gate. “I’m Rahmat Khan,” Raza’s father said, “I’m the angarakha maker to His Majesty and I’ve brought new sets for him.” “Is His Majesty expecting you?” the guard with big moustaches asked. “Ji huzoor. He chose the designs himself.” “Wait here,” the guard turned to go inside, “I’ll call the Royal Steward.”After a while the guard returned with another man. Rahmat bowed to him. “I’ve brought the summer clothes, Dhaniji,” he said. “Good! Come with me. His Majesty is still in his sleeping chamber. He’ll see you before he leaves for the royal court.” As they walked in, Raza whispered, “Who is he, Abbu?” “Dhani Singh. He works in the Khwabgah.” “Khwabgah?” “The king’s personal palace, where he has his sitting room and bedroom.” It was a long walk. Raza looked around, his eyes wide with wonder. The Mughal palaces were so beautiful! All made of red sandstone with slim carved pillars and curving arches.In between were gardens filled with flowers, lily pools and sparkling fountains. Raza thought he was in heaven. As they waited at the door of the king’s bedroom, Raza studied Dhani Singh. Being a tailor’s son, he noticed the clothes first. Dhani Singh was wearing a cotton angarakha in a red and white flowery print over white churidars. His nagra shoes had pointed toes that curved inward. He had tied a narrow cloth belt, a patka, at his waist. What Raza liked most was his bright red turban, printed with a design in white and yellow squares and dots.“Your turban is very nice, Dhaniji,” he said, “that’s a really pretty design!” “Thank you! I come from the land of the Rajputs and. . . this design, called bandhani, is from my homeland.” As they entered the room, Raza’s heart was thudding. Sunlight poured in through the arched doorways, lighting up the thick silken Persian carpet woven in jewelled colours. The room was furnished with a beautifully carved bed and exquisite chairs. There were silk and gold cushions on the low bed. Even the curtains were made of silk! Raza bowed and then looked at his king. Akbar was choosing jewellery from a box held before him by a servant.He was not very tall but he had the broad shoulders of a swordfighter. He had large, slightly slanted eyes, a drooping moustache, and a small mole above his lips. Hearing them enter, Akbar turned and smiled, “Ah Rahmat! You’ve brought the angarakhas? And who is this boy with you?” “My son Raza, huzoor.” “And can you stitch too, Raza?” “I’m learning, huzoor,” Raza replied nervously, “but I still make mistakes in cutting the cloth.” “You’ll learn. Your father will teach you,” Akbar said gently. Rahmat opened the bundle and laid out the angarakhas on the bed.They were made of the finest muslin and covered with delicate embroidery. All of them were in light summery colours – cream, lemon, pale blue, green and a sparkling white. Raza knew the king’s favourite colour was white. Rahmat helped Akbar put on a white angarakha. Then Dhani Singh brought a large mirror and held it before the king. “I like the embroidery. . . and it fits well too,” Akbar said, looking pleased. “Now tie a patka. Let’s see how it looks.” Rahmat took out a handful of belts and tied a light blue one around Akbar’s waist, letting the fringed ends hang in front. “No…” said Akbar moodily, “this is too pale… I want something brighter.”Raza and his father then tried one patka after another – green and yellow, orange and purple, but nothing pleased Akbar. “I don’t like any of the colours, Rahmat!” Akbar said, frowning impatiently. Raza saw that his father was beginning to look worried. Oh no! If His Majesty did not like the patkas, would he send all the clothes back? “I have to do something fast!” Raza thought. He looked around and said suddenly, “Huzoor, would you like to try a bright red one with a white and yellow design?” “What kind of red?” Akbar boomed. “Show me!” Raza pointed to Dhani Singh’s turban, “That red?” “Hmmm…” Akbar stared thoughtfully at Dhani Singh’s moustached face and said, “Let me give it a try.”In a flash, Raza had taken off Dhani Singh’s turban, unrolled it and tied it around Akbar’s waist. He waited with bated breath while Akbar studied his reflection in the mirror. He noticed Dhani Singh grinning widely – he must have been amused to see the king wearing his turban as a belt! “I like the colour… and a new design too!” Akbar said finally. “Bandhani, huzoor… from the land of the Rajputs,” said Raza promptly. “Aha! Rajput like my queen, Jodh Bai!” Akbar began to smile. “Dhani, pay Rahmat for the angarakhas and patkas. I’ll take them all!” “Huzoor,” asked Raza cautiously, “Dhaniji needs a turban. We’ve taken the one he was wearing.” “Give him a patka!” laughed Akbar. “That boring pale blue one. I am keeping his turban.”FUN FACTS OF HISTORY . Raza lived during the reign of King Akbar over  years ago. Akbar was the greatest king of the Mughal dynasty. He was also a famous warrior. He loved wearing clothes with new designs. He also enjoyed flying kites and eating mangoes!. Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty, was the king of Kabul. He invaded India in  and defeated the Sultan of Delhi, Ibrahim Lodi, at the Battle of Panipat. Akbar was Babur's grandson. He was an equally successful general and never lost a battle during his  year rule. . Two Mughal kings built new cities. Akbar built Fatehpur Sikri near Agra and Shahjahan built Shahjahanabad in Delhi. Fatehpur Sikri lies empty today but Shahjahanabad (presentday Old Delhi) is full of life and people.. Shahjahan’s famous Peacock Throne was a square flat seat, with slim pillars at each corner covered with precious jewels. The seat had a canopy, which had the figure of a peacock studded with gems on top of it. The emperor sat under the canopy, leaning against silk cushions.. Many Mughal princesses were highly educated. Gulbadan Begum wrote the biography of her father, Babur. Shahjahan’s daughter Jahanara was a poet. . The Mughal fort had many kitchens. Each kitchen sent food for the king. So when he sat down to eat, he would have as many as thirty dishes to choose from! Lipsmacking Mughlai cusine, which includes yummy dishes like biryani, pulao, kalia and korma, originated in these kitchens.	./Story text files/89.txt	7130	14	5.884467265725289	634	145	141	51.051094890510946	72	65	28	10.087591240875913	59	78	380	399	5	1.510567296996663	792	107
"Basha and his sister Sainabi live in Hyderabad with their parents. Basha loves food. What he loves more is to cook food. He helps his Ammi in the kitchen everyday. He likes to watch her hands as they chop the brightly coloured vegetables — plump red tomatoes, crisp green capsicums, firm orange carrots, fleshy pink onions. . . “Mmmm!” Basha loves the tempting aromas that swirl around Ammi's kitchen as the dhals, rice, vegetables, meat, and spices change colour on the stove. He hopes that Ammi will give him a chance to cook a dish on his own someday.One day, Basha and Sainabi come back from school to find Ammi asleep with high fever. Baba is not yet back from his office. Ammi’s mobile rings. Basha sees that Ammi’s best friend Saira aunty is calling and answers it quickly. He does not want to wake Ammi up. “I’m on my way back home from a wedding with lots of friends,” Saira aunty explains. She sounds exhausted. “We will be passing by your home in about two hours' time. Do you think we can have dinner at your place? There are  of us  and  are vegetarian. "" Basha knows that Ammi would love to see them. He and Sainabi are very fond of Saira aunty too. “You are most welcome, "" Basha says.He feels excited as he hangs up the phone. This is his chance to cook a dish on his own! But will he be able to do it? He feels nervous. He opens the fridge and sees many of his favourite vegetables  cauliflower, peas, beans. He can also see a bunch of fresh mint leaves peeking out from under the carrots. ""Yes! "" he thinks to himself. ""I have everything I need for a yummy Vegetable Dum Biryani! "" Basha has watched Ammi cook Vegetable Dum Biryani many times for their family of . But he now has to cook for  people! That is six times* the number of people Ammi usually cooks it for! *(+++++ = . Or, x = ) ""That means, "" thinks Basha to himself, feeling a little nervous, ""I have to cook the biryani six times! "" Would he have enough time to do that?As he starts to lay out six of every vessel he needs for the cooking, Sainabi appears at the kitchen door. “What are you up to?” she asks, frowning. When Basha explains to her what he is doing, she starts to laugh loudly. “Buddhu!” she teases him. “You don’t need to make the dish  times! You just have to have to make it ONCE, but with  times the quantities of all the ingredients needed. "" Basha doesn't like to be teased by his smart little sister. Of COURSE he doesn't have to make the biryani six times! He could kick himself for his silly mistake. ""I knew it all the time, "" he says quickly. ""I just wanted to see if YOU knew it. "" “Of course you did, Bhai, "" Sainabi says soothingly, but her eyes twinkle mischievously. ""So, tell me, how much rice do we need for  people?” “.  cups.” “Then you’ll need .  x  =  cups of rice for  people, "" Sainabi replies instantly.Basha stares at her. How does Sainabi work out those numbers so quickly in her head? ""That's right, "" he says gruffly, measuring out the rice into a big vessel. ""Now, why don't you tell me how much we need of all the other ingredients too, and I will tell you if you are right. "" ""Sure, Bhai! "" says Sainabi, running to get a pencil and paper. She loves it when her brother involves her in something he is doing. As Basha tells her the list of ingredients needed for four people, she calculates the quantities for . "" green beans for  people, "" calls out Basha. ""That means. . .  x  =  green beans for ! "" says Sainabi. "" cup of curd for  people. "" ""That means x  = .  x  = .  cups of curd for , "" says Sainabi, working it out on her paper quickly. ""I hope we have that much curd in the fridge. "" ""We do, "" says Basha. ""Next. . . "" Finally, they have measured out all the ingredients.“Can you help me with the chopping too?” Basha asks, realizing that there are a lot of vegetables to be chopped. “Of course, Bhai,” grins Sainabi. Today is her lucky day! Basha first soaks the fine orange strands of saffron in milk and the rice in water. He then joins Sainabi in chopping the vegetables. Then he turns on the stove and starts roasting the spices  cinnamon, cloves, green cardamoms, black cardamoms  and all the chopped vegetables, in ghee. The familiar pleasant aromas of good food start to fill the house. Basha starts to gain confidence in himself. He can’t wait to get to his favourite part now  layering and slowcooking the halfcooked rice, spices and vegetables in a handi. As Basha sets up the handi and starts to slowcook it on the tawa, the doorbell rings. Before he and Sainabi can get to the door, Ammi has woken up and is greeting the guests with a surprised look on her face. Her surprise turns to worry as she realizes that they’re here for dinner and she hasn’t cooked anything.She follows the pleasant smells and reaches the kitchen. “Surprise!” shout Basha and Sainabi as they whip the lid off the handi. Ammi is stunned. “Basha is a great cook, Ammi. He has made biryani! I helped him make it,” Sainabi says. Basha smiles proudly at Ammi, thinking that his little sister is not so bad after all. Ammi hugs Basha and Sainabi. ""Mashallah! "" she smiles. ""I have two really fine kids. I am so proud of you both. "" ""Why don't you join Saira aunty and the others, Ammi? "" says Basha. ""Sainabi and I will serve you all. "" Sainabi nods eagerly. Maybe Bhai will ask her to help him with more things from now on! She can't stop smiling at the thought. “This is the best Dum Biryani we’ve ever had!” say Saira aunty and her friends. ""I agree   percent! "" says Ammi, licking her fingers. Basha and Sainabi are all smiles!Cook with Basha and Sainabi! Guess what! Basha and Sainabi's Ammi sweetly agreed to share her Dum Biryani recipe with us!

They can float around in the air that we breathe, and sit on things we touch. When these viruses get into your nose and throat, they give you a sore throat, or a headache, or a clogged nose  or even all three at the same time! A cold can move very quickly from you to your friends. If you touch your friends when you have a cold, or sneeze or cough near them, they too will fall sick. Did you know that a single cough or sneeze can shoot your nose and throat viruses  feet through the air? How terrible!This is how you can avoid catching a cold: Stay far away from anyone who has a bad cold. If you meet or shake hands with someone who has a cold, wash your hands well. Otherwise, the virus will travel from your hands to your nose. Do not share drinking glasses, eating utensils or clothes with someone who has a cold. Eat lots of vegetables and fruits, drink plenty of water, exercise, keep warm and stay healthy!"	./Story text files/266.txt	1803	22	6.043010752688172	133	53	148	29.066666666666666	49	11	32	6.216666666666667	46	14	85	101	5	1.161825726141079	229	12
Droso was a newborn fruit fly. He opened his wings for the first time, and flapped them up and down very fast.  times in one second to be exact! “WOW I’m flying!” he shouted.Droso looked down at the rotten banana on which he was born. What a view! His sister Phila was finding her wings too. “How high can I fly?” Droso wondered and flew a little higher.Phila liked going up too but not as much as she liked to pose. One leg here, two legs there, and the other three over there. She posed in different ways. “I want to be a model,” she announced.The next day, Droso flew to the top of the fruit basket. The day after that, he made it to the top of the refrigerator. Higher and higher Droso flew, until . . . … he hit the ceiling. He couldn't fly any higher!You see, Droso and Phila were inside Richa's house. Richa was an astronaut. In two weeks, Richa would sit in a rocket and shoot up into space. She had been so busy planning her trip, that she hadn’t noticed her bananas were rotting.Richa the astronaut was not so different from Droso the fruit fly. Like Droso, Richa also wanted to go to higher places. Flying to space had always been Richa’s dream. And it was about to come true. How exciting!All Richa thought about was space! Space is a hundred kilometres from the ground. It has no air to breathe and no ground to stand on. There is no up and no down! So in space, nothing falls down. Astronauts like Richa just float around. What a strange place!Richa often wondered, “How would birds fly in a place like space where there is no up and no down?” There was only one way to find out. “I’ll take a bird with me to space!” she decided.But which one? A pigeon, perhaps? No, it has too many feathers. A crow? Too big. A sparrow? Too noisy. Also, it eats too much.Richa thought long and hard until she got very hungry. She reached for the fruit basket. “Yuck, rotten fruits!” And that’s when she saw Droso and Phila buzzing around. “Fruit flies!” cried out Richa. “They are perfect for space!”She put Droso and Phila in a jar. She also put some rotten banana goop in the jar for them to eat. Then, she threw out the rotting banana and made herself a sandwich.Today is the day Richa is flying into space. Look at what is in her hand!Phila is the first ever space model. Astronauts take many photos of her eating and resting in space. And Droso? Richa and her scientist friends closely watch how he uses his wings in space.Look! Droso the fruit fly is finally going high, high, high. . . higher than any other fly in the world.Animals in Space Drosophila is the scientific name of the fruit fly. The fruit fly was the first animal to travel to space. This happened in . Did you know that fruit flies and humans have some things in common? They can remember things just like us, and they even fall sick like we do! Which is why scientists love to study fruit flies in space. After all, it's easier to send flies to space than humans! And this is why fruit flies are known as model organisms. Do you know who else has been to space? Albert the monkey, Laika the dog, Ham the chimpanzee, and Arabella the spider!	./Story text files/249.txt	3112	14	5.561514195583596	277	40	97	37.4320987654321	53	28	20	8.234567901234568	43	38	205	112	5	1.2797927461139897	356	30
"""Why did they give this away? "" Kalpana asked in wonder. She was looking at what Amma had brought home from work. A cycle as good as new! Amma shrugged. ""The child got another one, "" she said.Kalpana climbed on the cycle. DUMMMMMMMM! She fell. Prabhu laughed. ""You can’t balance on two wheels! You’ve to learn how to ride it, "" he said. ""Teach me, "" Kalpana begged him.So every evening, after school, they went to the bungalow road. There wasn’t much traffic there. Only big houses with big dogs.All the children from their area went to play there. On the first day, Kalpana couldn’t wait to start. But. . .DUMMMMMM! Kalpana fell to the ground. Her knees were on fire. She didn’t want to cry. But she did. Great, big sobs escaped from her mouth.Her ears felt hot. She could hear the boys laughing. Kalpana got up and ran home. She left the cycle where it was. Prabhu would ride it back. He knew how to. After he was done playing cricket with his friends. After the sun had set. After Appa was home from the mechanic shop.""How did you tear your skirt? "" asked Amma, when she saw Kalpana. ""I fell from the cycle, "" Kalpana said. Amma sighed.Today was the seventh day of Kalpana’s lessons. And she still hadn’t been able to do it. What was it that Prabhu had said? She was too short for the cycle! What did Prabhu know?At night, Kalpana asked Amma for a glass of milk. Her teacher had said that drinking milk would make children tall. And Kalpana was the second tallest girl in II B already.She wanted to become like Venus Williams. Kalpana didn’t know anything about tennis. But Prabhu had shown her a poster of Venus once. ""How strong she is! "" Kalpana had said. If Kalpana became so strong, nobody would bother her. Kalpana prayed before going to sleep. Something she did not do otherwise.The next evening, she was sure she would ride the cycle. She was even wearing her lucky red hairclip. ""Push and just let me go, "" she told Prabhu. He did just that. Kalpana closed her eyes and tried to find the pedals. The wind rushed in her ears. The cycle wobbled on the road and then. . . DUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM! Kalpana fell. AGAIN.This time, the pain was so bad, she couldn’t breathe. Nobody was laughing. Not even Manikandan, who was always so mean.The doctor was very stern. Like her school principal. He told Kalpana that she’d bruised her leg badly. ""You’ve to take care of it till it heals, "" he said. He gave Amma a long list of medicines. ""No more cycling till the bruise goes off, "" Amma said. Kalpana nodded. ""You can still sit on the cycle though, "" said Prabhu. ""How? "" asked Kalpana.Appa showed her the cycle. It had a brand new pillion seat. ""We got it fixed when you were at the doctor’s! "" grinned Prabhu. ""But I will ride it myself soon, "" she said. ""Yes, "" said Prabhu. ""You will. ""Kalpana fell off the cycle but so what? Everyone tells you to keep trying even if you don't succeed. Why? Trying sometimes gives you results that you're not looking for. It teaches you something about yourself that you never knew. If Kalpana had learnt to ride the cycle on the very first day, she might have never known how determined a person she is! Her family might have never realised this about her too. Maybe someday in the future, when Kalpana becomes tall and strong after drinking many cups of milk, she will think back to the day she fell from her cycle. Maybe it will happen when Kalpana has a difficult exam to write or is hiking up a mountain. Maybe it will happen when she is baking a cake or taking pictures of a tiger. And maybe Kalpana will make up her mind not to give up because she still remembers what she learned that day on her cycle."	./Story text files/287.txt	3647	19	5.4	349	51	155	35.48	78	22	30	7.74	61	39	260	140	4	1.2526539278131634	418	53

"As soon as their father left for work, Ramesh swept up the broken glass while Valli made tea.Though she was only eight years old, she had already learnt how to make the strong, sweet tea that their mother liked. In between sips, Amma held the warm glass to her throbbing forehead. And to her swollen cheek. I fell. I tripped. The glass shattered when I dropped it. These were Amma’s usual excuses. And no one looked beyond what she said. Not even when the children started repeating the lies.“Buying bread for the third day in a row?” asked Murugan, the owner of the neighbourhood store.There weren’t many customers at his store that morning so he chatted with Valli as he entered her purchases into his account book. “If your Amma is still not well enough to cook, don’t you think you should take her to the doctor?” “It’s not that kind of illness, Murugan anna,” Valli sighed. “What kind of illness is it then?” Murugan persisted. “Just that her arm is hurting very badly. Because she tripped on the road and fell straight on her shoulder,” Valli repeated her mother’s lie. But her eyes told another story. And though she avoided Murugan’s eyes, he felt very uneasy. Something was not right. He discussed it with his wife, Sarasa, later that evening and was shocked to hear the truth about Valli’s mother, Meenakshi.“It’s not tripping or falling. It’s her monster of a husband. Looks like he wouldn’t hurt a fly! But that’s just a mask. Poor Meenakshi — she puts up with all his blows and beatings to protect the children.”Murugan was very upset. “I didn’t know this. Why didn’t you tell me earlier? We should have done something.” After all, both families had lived on the same street for years. It wasn’t right that Meenakshi and her children should suffer like this. “You mean you’ve never noticed?” Sarasa was surprised, “Meenakshi’s bruises? The cut lip some weeks ago? It breaks my heart,” she sighed. “But what can we do? Interfering might only make things worse.” Murugan wondered how he could help without making things worse for Meenakshi and her children. He thought about it deeply before coming up with a plan. The help Murugan arranged arrived at Valli’s door some days later. It came with a wide smile and dressed in a khaki police uniform.“I’m Sub Inspector Jaya,” the young policewoman introduced herself. “My uncle, Murugan maama, asked me to visit you. I got off duty early today, so I stopped here on my way home.”Luckily for Valli and her family, Appa was travelling on work. When their father was at home, the three of them lived under a cloud of fear, always scared about doing something that could set off his violent temper. “Don’t make Appa angry,” Meenakshi would beg her children every day. “No singing, Ramesh. Please! Don’t bounce that ball, Valli.”SI Jaya listened patiently when the children told her all of this. Then she and Amma spoke in low voices for a long time while the children did their homework. When it was time to leave, Jaya insisted that they note down her mobile number. “You can call me anytime. Day or night. And if I can’t come myself, I’ll have the beat policeman at your door in minutes,” she promised. “But I don’t have a phone,” Amma pointed out, “My husband refuses to let me have one.”Jaya made Amma write down her number anyway. “This terrible situation is not your fault,” were her parting words to them as she got onto her bike. “This violence is not okay. And the three of you should never suffer in silence thinking it is normal. Meenakshi, you must think about what we’ve discussed and do some of the things I’ve suggested.”After she left, Valli asked Amma what Jaya meant. “The SI wants me to write to someone in our family telling them how things are. She says we should not keep hiding our problem. That we should share our problem with people who care for us. She also said I could file a complaint at our Police Station if I wanted. But I don’t know what to do. Will any of this really help us?”Ramesh nodded gloomily. He was moody, and suspicious of everyone these days. More so ever since he too had become the target of Appa’s anger whenever he rushed to help Amma. “The SI wouldn’t have given us her personal number anyway. Try calling that number,” he challenged his mother and sister bitterly, “I bet you a full bar of chocolate that you’ll just get a recorded message. Or no one will answer.” “Let’s write to someone first then. Why not write to Paati?” Valli knew Appa was a little scared of his mother.It took a few days, but Amma did finally write to Paati. Then, they all waited eagerly for a reply. A visit from Paati would be nice. She was strict with them but what fun they had when she visited, bringing tins of homemade snacks with her.She would braid Valli’s hair in a new way each day and play cricket with them in the tiny lane. Amma would join them sometimes too. Paati and Ramesh would sing together at home, and though Appa would look very irritated, he would control his temper when Paati was there. Yes, their grandmother would tell Appa that his violence was not acceptable.But when two weeks passed with no answer from Paati, all three grew downcast. What could they do next, they wondered sadly. Appa had been travelling for a week and when he returned, he had some news for them. “My mother called me a few days ago,” he said gruffly. “She’s arriving here tomorrow. She wants to stay a few months. Months! I can’t understand why. Here…” he flung some money on the kitchen counter. “Pay the bill at the store and don’t forget to buy my mother’s special brand of coffee when you buy the provisions for the month.” As soon as he left, slamming the door angrily behind him, the children were jumping with excitement. “Give us a little of that money to buy sweets, Amma!” Ramesh pleaded. Amma agreed. More rare than the money she gave each of them, was the halfsmile on her face.On their way to school, Valli made Ramesh stop at Murugan’s store. After SI Jaya’s visit to their home, Murugan made it a point to talk to the children whenever he could. He was busy when they entered the store, so Valli prodded Ramesh to the place where the sweets were displayed.“You had better buy me that full bar of chocolate before you spend your money on anything else,” she demanded, “Because I am surely going to win the bet.” It took Ramesh a minute to remember the bet he had made the day SI Jaya had visited. He laughed and told his sister to hurry up. When Valli had chosen what she wanted, she went up to Murugan and asked whether she could make a call from his phone. She dialed Jaya’s number. “Yes, Murugan maama,” answered a familiar voice at the other end.Valli wiggled her thumb at Ramesh. So much for him thinking that the policewoman wouldn’t answer their call.""Jaya akka, it’s me. Valli. "" “Is everything alright, Valli? Do you need help?” Jaya sounded concerned. “We’re fine, akka. I just called to tell you that my Paati is coming to stay with us for a few months because Amma wrote telling her about Appa. And… how bad things were.” “That’s such good news! And now you also know how to reach me, right? You can call me any time for help.”The call over and Murugan’s many questions answered, the children started unwrapping their chocolate as they left the store. Valli’s heart felt lighter. Not just because of the chocolate they were sharing. Not even because of the whole extra bar she had won from her brother.But because, for the first time in months, she could hear Ramesh singing softly to himself as they walked to school.How children can cope with violence in the home Children who live with an abusive or violent parent often feel scared or angry or ashamed. This is only natural. If you know anyone in this situation, let them know that: No one should suffer violence in silence. All children and adults have the right to live in safety, especially within their home. The violence is never the child’s fault. The child’s actions or behaviour does not cause the violence. Violence in the home is a crime. In India, the law provides protection to children and women once the crime is reported. Those found guilty of the crime will be punished.When children cannot act on their own to report abuse, their friends and classmates can help by: Suggesting they share the problem with trusted people and following up until they do. Trusted adults could be grandparents, aunts, uncles, neighbours, school principal. Discussing the problem with their own parents and seeking their help. Calling for help on their behalf if required. Call . This is CHILDLINE, the hour helpline which can be dialled from any part of India by any child or adult. It provides immediate help to children seeking protection from child abuse, violence against their parent at home, any crime against children."	./Story text files/159.txt	8783	17	5.9550691244239635	681	187	181	58.351351351351354	73	75	31	11.54054054054054	60	88	507	361	5	1.5005065856129687	847	140
YAWN! Kottavi Raja was sleepy. His ministers were talking about a complex problem and he was bored. He hadn’t slept well last night, or the night before. Or the thirty nights before that. He tried to concentrate on what they were saying. But the sentences were so garbled!“Insofar as the lessee is concerned, the right glablaglablaaa to till and tax blblblublooo loooballaooozzzzzzzzzzzz.” His head lolled forward. Raja Nalan was a good king. But of late, he had a problem staying awake during the day. He yawned in court all the time. So people had started calling him Kottavi Raja, because ‘kottavi’ means ‘yawn’ in Tamil.“Sujata,” he asked his queen one night, gently waking her up, “how come you are so alert and energetic throughout the day?” “Because I sleep at night,” she snapped. “And so should you.” Yes, sleep at night. But how? He was always sleepy during the day, sleepiest in the evening. But by night, he was alert, not at all sleepy! The next morning, in court, Kottavi Raja asked, “Prime Minister, what do you do when you aren’t sleepy at night?” “I ask Nidra Devi, the goddess of sleep, to bless me,” he said. “How?” “My mother used to say the goddess cannot resist a full stomach. So I ask my cook to serve a rich dinner, full of warm, sweet things. Two minutes after eating it, I’m fast asleep.” Kottavi Raja saw the minister’s round stomach. And believed him.The Finance Minister did not want to be left out. So he said, “I drink warm milk with honey at night. Simple, no fuss. No need to trouble the cook. And I always sleep a full nine hours.” The court musician did not like all these stories of food. When his stomach was full, he couldn’t sing. But he wanted to help. So he said, “In our family, my lord, we always invite Nidra Devi with music. A beautiful Neelambari, sung with the veena… Ah, bliss!”The poet said, “A gentle stroll in the palace gardens with a soft breeze blowing and the moonlight falling on parijatham f lowers. . . . ah! The beauty and poetry of the moment will wash away all your worries, Maharaja. Nidra Devi loves a peaceful mind.” The court jester added, “If nothing else works, my lord, a good story will always get you to sleep.”‘So many things to try, ’ thought Kottavi Raja. ‘One of them has to work. ’ That evening, the royal cooks were asked to prepare a special meal.Warm rice with ghee, hot sambar, fried potatoes, yam and khus khus payasam. And, to wash it all down, cool buttermilk. The king wanted to be sure that he would sleep at night, so he took two helpings of every dish. It was nearly  pm when he finished. Yet – old habits are hard to break – he wasn’t sleepy.He tossed and he turned and he became very unhappy with his Prime Minister. Nidra Devi was missing! He decided he simply hadn’t eaten enough. “Cook!” he bellowed. A sleepy cook hurriedly dressed and ran to the king. “Get me a large glass of warm milk with honey! Hurry!”Kottavi Raja gulped it down. Ouch! He was soooo full. He couldn’t get up, he couldn’t move and he definitely couldn’t lie down and fall asleep. ‘Perhaps I should try music, ’ he thought. He sent for the court musicians. They came, turbans askew, with hurriedly tied dhotis. It was past midnight.“Play Neelambari for me!” he said. It was wonderful to listen to the melody in the still night. Kottavi Raja relaxed. What bliss! Twenty minutes later, his eyelids began to droop. . . Then – TWANG! THUD! The veena player had fallen asleep on his instrument. .They began again. But one after the other, the sleepy musicians dropped notes and played the wrong tune. It was cacophony. Nidra Devi heard those tunes and bolted! And the king was wide awake and very annoyed. He remembered his jester’s idea and summoned him. “Tell me a story!” he said.The jester started a long boring story, hoping that the king would fall asleep. Ah, but our Kottavi Raja was not pleased. He got impatient and kept saying, “Yes, yes, but how does the story end?” Nidra Devi didn’t like the impatience. So she kept away. One hour later, a hoarse jester ended the story and went home blearyeyed. And the king? He was still awake. He woke the queen up and insisted on taking a stroll. She got ready grumpily.“Just up to the jasmine garden, okay? After that I’ll come back and sleep!” They walked in the moonshine, heard the drowsy tittering of birds and went around the large palace garden. The king found himself calming down and thought, ‘Aha! Now is the time to go back and sleep. ’ As he settled down, there was a dreamy silence all around. Until he heard a curious rumbling. From his stomach. The music, the story, the breeze, and the walk had made him hungry!The queen took matters into her hands. She ordered a small glass of milk, and got a masseuse to press his legs. In a few minutes, Nidra Devi came and blessed the king. The palace finally shut down for the night.Every day, this routine continued. Over time, Kottavi Raja started to sleep earlier. In two weeks, he found that he fell asleep after his second glass of milk. A few weeks after that, he started sleeping just after his walk. A month later, the jester’s story put him to sleep. And finally, he managed to sleep right after dinner. Most mornings, he woke up feeling fresh! He walked with a bounce in his step and smiled at everyone.But what about the cooks, the musicians, the jester, the masseuse, the queen? They remained on standby through the night – they never knew when the king might wake and ask for them. And they were sleepy, tired and grumpy all day. So were the people who waited for them  the cook’s wife, the musician’s son, the jester’s brother, the masseuse’s father, the queen’s maid, the maid’s husband, the husband’s brother, the brother’s friend, the friend’s parents. . . the whole city. The king grew worried about his sleepless people. He couldn’t recommend his elaborate remedy to everyone. So he asked his chief priest for a solution. The wise man knew that this was a tough problem. He said, “Get everyone to assemble in the town hall fifteen days from now. They should have a warm bath, finish dinner and arrive at sunset. I will summon Nidra Devi to bless everyone.”So the entire city gathered. They were all relieved that their sleepless nights were going to end. The priest began to chant hymns in praise of the goddess.A few minutes into his droning, a new mother, the sleepiest of them all, yawned. Looking at her, her infant yawned. The baby’s father saw this and. . . yes, yawned. A musician yawned halfway through a tune, and twenty people around him yawned. Then, their neighbours yawned and a mighty wave of yawns swept through the gathering.Nidra Devi couldn’t resist the power of so many yawns. She came running to the city, and touched everyone with a cooling breeze. And from that night onwards, she continued to bless everyone in Kottavi Raja’s land, every night.	./Story text files/238.txt	6850	26	5.840055632823366	591	128	226	44.67333333333333	92	58	37	9.173333333333334	69	81	420	299	5	1.3934040047114251	758	91
Today, we will climb up a ladder together. It is a rather unusual ladder. In this ladder, the distance between the rungs gets bigger and BIGGER and BIGGER as you climb up the steps, growing  times at each step. Sometimes we will climb one step at a time and at other times we will skip many steps at one go. The funny thing is that we are not even sure which the last step is or whether the steps go on forever. Let the exciting journey begin!Step :  metre What do a five year old boy, a cricket bat and a newborn baby elephant have in common? All of them have a height of about  metre (or m for short)! It would be awkward to say that the ceiling of a room is  baby elephants high. So we make the sensible choice of saying that the height of the ceiling is  metres.Step :  metres Now that you have a feel for the size of one metre, we are ready to climb to the next step of our ladder, at  metres. A three storey building or a mango tree is roughly  metres high. A cricket pitch is about twice that length. Can you think of other objects that are about  m long or high?Step :  metres Have you noticed that with every step we add a zero to the right of the number we had before and the step number matches the number of zeroes? Keep track of that as we climb along. If you have run the m race on school sports day, or watched sprinters do it on TV, you know exactly how far that is. Now imagine if the m track stood up! That would be about the height of two Gol Gumbaz*es. *The Gol Gumbaz in Bijapur, Karnataka, is the tomb of Mohammed Adil Shah. When it was built in , it had the largest dome in the world. It held the record until !Step :  metres Thousand metres has a special name  it is called  kilometre or  km. You would cover this distance if you ran the  metre race  times  phew! You would need to climb about  km to reach the top of Mount Everest.Step : , ,  metres Now let's skip  steps and go to step , which has six zeroes to the right of . The distance from the northern tip of India in Kashmir to the southern tip at Kanyakumari is about  times this distance, or  times , ,  m, or , ,  m. Because , ,  m is quite a mouthful, we usually say  km, which is the same thing.Step : , , ,  metres How far away is the bright, beautiful moon? It is right there on the th step of our distance ladder at about  times , , ,  m, or , ,  km away from the earth!Step : , , , , ,  metres Let us skip two more steps and race to the blazing hot Sun. How far away is it? It is about , , ,  km PLUS another , , ,  km. That is very, VERY far away indeed! But the far, far away sun still lights up the world and makes us sweat in summer. Amazing, isn't it?Last Step? ? ? Is there a last step on the ladder? We don’t know yet! But with powerful telescopes, scientists have been able to see way beyond the sun. The farthest object that they have been able to spot is on the th step, , , , , , , , , , , , ,  m away! That is SERIOUSLY FAR! Maybe when you grow up, you can discover something even further away, on the th or th step. Isn’t that an exciting thought?Fun with Measuring The following activity done in a classroom setting is a great way to give children a feel for large distances and can engage the children either in a single group, or in teams. . Ask the children to cut long strips (each about an inch wide) from old newspapers. . Ask them to stick the strips end to end with tape or glue to make longer strips, until they get a strip that is  metre long (they can use a measuring tape for this). . Now ask the children to use this  m long strip as a measure and make  similar strips and stick them end to end to make a  m long strip. They can lie down next to this strip, head to head and feet to feet, and see how many of them it takes to make  m. . They can then stick ten  m strips together to make a  m strip that goes round the classroom many times. . What about a  km strip? How many times does that go around the classroom? Which team was able to create a  km long strip fastest?Notes for Parents & Teachers:  When writing down big numbers with lots of zeroes after the , it is very easy for children  and adults!  to make mistakes. That is why the 'Powers of ' notation is such a useful thing. Through this book, children can be taught how to use it  all they need to do is to count the number of zeroes to the right of the , and write that number as a superscript of . For instance, , which has  zeroes after the , can be written as . And  ( zeroes after the ), can be compactly written as  . Simple!  In this book, we stopped our 'How far is far? ' game at the Sun. If you want to take the game further, you may want to bring in the nearest star beyond the Sun, Proxima Centauri, which is  m away from the Sun. Or the distance from one end of the Milky Way to another, which is , , , , , , , , , ,  (or ) m!  One thing you should know is that the distances that are given in the book are approximate, not exactly accurate. For example,  km is given as  km. This is not 'unscientific'. Rough estimates are very useful in science! Maybe you can do an activity with the kids to emphasize this. Is the length of a pencil closer to  cm or  cms? Is the weight of the school bus closer to  kgs or  kgs? Let the children come up with their own questions for their classmates too.	./Story text files/146.txt	5286	15	4.77681660899654	498	80	194	65.0875	34	46	40	15.225	25	55	401	177	5	1.1836158192090396	651	57
"One morning not so long ago, Raju was on his way to school as usual. He loved school and was walking along happily, looking forward to the day. That was when he saw something very strange: ahead of him were some unusual shapes, heading towards school themselves, schoolbags slung over their shoulders.As he came closer to the shapes, Raju wondered if they were vegetables, the kind he had seen so often in the market. He rubbed his eyes in disbelief.The vegetables looked fresh and healthy. They were marching towards school like little soldiers, one behind the other.Raju walked faster and faster. He was full of curiosity about his new schoolmates, and wanted a closer look at them.At long last, Raju caught up with the shapes marching ahead of him. He stared at their faces, mouth open in surprise.Just as he had guessed, the shapes were really vegetables: potatoes, sweet potatoes, yams, and all the other root vegetables he had seen in the market.""What? Is it really you? "" The question popped out of his mouth before he realized it. The vegetables did not reply. They just looked at each other and smiled, amused at his amazement.“Where are you going?” asked Raju in wonder. “Where else?” replied the vegetables, speaking together as one. “We’re on our way to your school!” Raju nodded. He didn’t know what to say. He continued on his way to school.A little while later, Raju looked back to see if the vegetables were still around. That was when he had his second surprise of the morning. A parade of green leafy vegetables had now joined the root vegetables. They were also marching towards his school, their schoolbags over their shoulders.Now that he was part of the parade himself, Raju's joy knew no bounds. No one he knew had ever gone to school as part of a vegetable parade before!By and by, the parade reached the school. All the children came to the door to watch the strange procession. Their mouths fell open at the sight. Their eyes were round with astonishment.Raju’s teacher came forward to welcome them. “Good boy!” she said, patting Raju on the back. Raju was delighted. “Thank you, teacher,” he said happily. The other children clapped and cheered. The teacher left but someone continued to pat him, and quite hard too.Raju opened his eyes. His mother was shaking him awake, saying, “Wake up, Raju! You’re going to be late for school.” Raju was fully awake now. “I’ve been dreaming,” he said to himself. “What a strange dream I’ve had!” Raju got out of bed, smiling to himself. He would have to hurry if he wanted to get to school on time.Use your imagination and colour this picture anyway you like.Use your imagination and colour this picture anyway you like."	./Story text files/351.txt	2685	19	6.255725190839694	199	63	157	49.679245283018865	30	23	26	9.754716981132075	29	24	177	85	5	1.5694915254237287	259	36
Knock, knock! Amma opened the door. “Raghu Mama!” Amish and Soni cried, giving him a big hug.Raghu Mama was their mother’s only brother. He always told the best stories and brought them the most interesting presents. But there was one problem with Raghu Mama.Raghu Mama was so lazy that he could sit in his chair, for hours and hours and hours, reading or watching TV. Or just sleeping. He would not do any work around the house or even go to the market to buy groceries. Amma was fed up of his laziness.“So, Raghu,” said Amma. “Planning to spend the holiday in your favourite chair as usual?” “Oh no!” said Raghu Mama. “This time I’m going to explore underwater caves, climb tall mountains, and chase tigers in the jungle.” “Where, where?” exclaimed Amish and Soni. “We want to come too!” “Hah!” said Amma. “What a joke!” Raghu Mama smiled mysteriously.The next day, when Raghu Mama was in his room, Amish and Soni overheard him talking to someone. “Wow!” he was saying. Then, “That’s AMAZING!” A little later, “OH NO!” The children burst into his room. “What happened, Raghu Mama?”Raghu Mama was in his favourite chair, wearing a pair of big black goggles. There was no one else around! Soni and Amish exchanged a curious look. “Is everything okay, Mama?” Amish asked, staring at the dark goggles that hid almost all of Mama’s face. Raghu laughed and took off the goggles. “Here, try this,” he said to Soni. “What is it?” asked Soni. The goggles were so heavy that she had to hold them with both hands.Raghu Mama carefully put the goggles on Soni’s face. The goggles were dark and she couldn’t see anything at first. Then he pressed a button. Suddenly Soni was in the ocean! There were colourful fish all around. She turned her face to the left and saw a big turtle swimming beside her. It was so close that she thought she could reach out and touch it. Then she turned her face to the other side . . . “Eek!” she cried as a huge shark swam very close to her.“Let me see, let me see!” said Amish, trying to take the goggles off a stunned Soni. “It will be your turn next, Amish,” said Raghu Mama. “I have just the adventure for you.” Amish put on the goggles and Mama pressed another button. “Ooh, I can see herds of chital! And langurs!” Amish was in a thick forest full of trees. He could hear different bird sounds. When he looked up, he could see a flock of geese flying in a V shaped formation across the sky.“It feels so real,” said Soni. “When I wore the goggles it was as if I were swimming underwater!” “Yes,” said Raghu Mama. “I guess that is why it is called ‘Virtual Reality’.” Soni was confused. “But doesn’t ‘virtual’ mean ‘not real’?” she asked. “So how can you have ‘reality’ that is not real?” “That is a really smart question,” said Raghu Mama. “We call it Virtual Reality, or VR, because it makes you feel that what you are watching is real. So it is almost real.” “Help!” cried Amish. “A tiger is about to eat me up!” Raghu Mama laughed. “Don’t worry, you are quite safe!” he told Amish. “It is like watching a movie, but better,” said Soni, excited. “Exactly,” said Mama. “When we watch a movie in a cinema theatre, the screen is only in front of us. When we wear the VR goggles, it feels like the movie is all around us.”“So, do you want to spend your summer vacation exploring Virtual Reality like me?” asked Raghu Mama. Amish took off the goggles and thought for a bit. “I think I prefer the REAL reality,” he said. “But why?” asked Raghu Mama, surprised. “I saw a juicy mango in the jungle,” said Amish. “And now I want to eat one. I can’t do that in Virtual Reality.” “I want one too!” said Soni. Both of them ran to the kitchen. “Wait for me!” said Raghu Mama, right behind them, finally off his favourite chair.Virtual Reality Bytes . The term “Virtual Reality” was first used in  in a science fiction story called The Judas Mandala by Damien Broderick. . Virtual Reality (VR) is made by very powerful computers that can use the small screens inside goggles to create a three dimensional (D) world that looks and feels very much like a real world. . VR goggles have sensors in them that detect how your eyes are moving. For example, if you look up, the picture in the goggles changes to what you would see if you were looking up in real life. So if you were in a jungle, like Amish, and looking up, the screen would show you a sky instead of the forest.. Virtual Reality is not just used for playing games and exploring new worlds. It can also be used to train people to do difficult jobs. Firefighters can use VR to practise rescuing people from burning buildings, and astronauts can practise living in space and exploring new worlds. Imagine being able to understand what walking on Mars would be like before even setting foot inside a spaceship! . Are VR goggles safe for children to use? Most scientists believe that it has the same effect as watching a small screen like a mobile phone, so we need to be careful about how often and how long we use it.	./Story text files/77.txt	4986	16	5.5913200723327305	464	89	191	42.74561403508772	77	37	35	9.043859649122806	67	47	334	219	4	1.3947772657450077	593	58

We are the oakum boys. We do everything together.Penguins don’t fly, they swim. But we’re too young to swim. So we walk.One day we went for a long walk. We walked and walked. Until we saw something new.He’s got something on his head!You’re changing! So are you!It’s not so bad! It’s not so cold!I will! But who’s going to teach us to swim?In this book you’ll meet king penguins, chinstrap penguins, and one lonely macaroni . . . as seen through the eyes of the oakum boys, which are what king penguin babies are before they grow up. All of these penguin species (and a few more) are found in Antarctica, the coldest, driest, windiest place on earth. It takes some very special qualities to survive in this harsh landscape. But if you are lucky enough to visit here, you will find that no matter how alike the penguins seem, each one is different – and all of them are special. We hope that by learning about these amazing animals, future generations will want to protect them as much as we do.	./Story text files/8.txt	993	17	5.84375	72	24	153	40.416666666666664	18	6	32	8.541666666666666	17	7	55	41	4	1.3539823008849559	101	12

My name is Eyad. Every morning, dada takes me to the balcony to listen to the birds. Pigeons are my favourite!There are always so many in the sky. Dada says they can carry messages and recognise our faces.Some are white, like my dada’s beard. Some are grey, like my dadi’s hair. Some have shades on their neck. I hope to find out more about them, when I grow up.The pigeons coo when they hear me hum. When I come too close, they fly away in a flock. They flap their wings so hard that some of their feathers fall off.The pigeons do backflips in the air. Does that mean they are happy?I wish I could do backflips too!They poop all over the balcony. That’s why dada hates them!But I do not want the pigeons to leave, I ask dada if I could keep one. “We cannot force them to stay,” dada says. “Birds are meant to fly wherever they want.”“Why can’t I fly?” I ask dada. “We all have special powers,” he says. “Pigeons can fly and see colours that are invisible to us.”“Do I have a special power?” I ask. “Yes,” dada says. “One day you will find it.” “I cannot wait,” I say. “Neither can I,” dada says.Did you know? Historically, pigeons were used to deliver important messages. That is because they have the amazing ability to return to their homes even when they are thousands of kilometres away in an unknown location. One of the greatest examples is a pigeon named Cher Ami. She was awarded a bravery medal from the French Army for saving  people in World War I by delivering a message even though she was injured. A note about pigeons Do not feed pigeons, they can manage by themselves! And like Eyad’s dada says, do not keep birds in cages. They are meant to fly in the sky.	./Story text files/268.txt	1674	15	5.658823529411765	140	30	142	41.94871794871795	27	12	28	9.051282051282051	23	16	84	86	5	1.4256410256410257	174	21

Her chosen career is as a professional pilot, she has worked in a variety of aviation capacities from instruction to airline flying, and is the author of several aviation text books. Danielle started writing children's books as a creative outlet from the stress of her 'day job' and as a break from the sometimes monotonous work required for her professional writing. She began with the Mac and Dipper series, aimed at  year olds, inspired by two of her own dogs. After having a child of her own, she suddenly found she had a muse, an eager resource for test reading, and, by benefit of her age, an honest critic all in one. It was fun and rewarding to write creative stories which matched her daughters learning curve. A series of 'junior' books aimed at   year old children followed. Encouraged by friends and family, and already familiar with the selfpublishing route through her nonfiction books, Danielle began publishing the books online so that others could enjoy them too. Because of her passion for children's literature and the role it plays in improved literacy standards, all of Danielle's own books are available for free download and may be used free of charge for noncommercial purposes.MORE BOOKS!

It’s easy to talk about the weather outside, even if it changes all the time.But it’s hard to talk about the weather inside me. Sometimes it feels like people don’t understand.Do you feel like that too?Some days my mind is full of sunshine and rainbows. I feel like I can do anything.On other days my head is full of fog and clouds. It’s hard to listen to what people are saying or to remember things.I sometimes wake up feeling like it’s windy and wild in my head. I feel tired and grumpy.And sometimes it feels like it’s raining inside me. It can be a drizzle making me feel sad, or a storm making me feel angry.Sometimes the weather inside me doesn’t match the weather outside.Sometimes my inside weather doesn’t match how I want to feel or how I think I should feel.Is that okay? Yes, of course it is.The best thing to do when we feel like our inside weather is strange is to tell someone we love, and talk about it.They’ve got inside weather too, and they’ll understand.	./Story text files/379.txt	975	17	5.847619047619047	88	17	114	50.36842105263158	9	10	24	10.368421052631579	8	11	76	29	4	1.4454545454545455	100	10

Tig’s mom is a scientist. She knows things.Tig’s dad is a writer. He makes things up.Tig has a globe. “Mom, if the world is round, why don’t the people on the bottom fall off?”“Because gravity pulls everyone towards the middle of the Earth.”“Wherever you go, the Earth feels like it is below you. Unless you go into space. Then there’s no down at all, and you float!”“People on the other side of the Earth think that they are the right way up. . . . . . and we are upside down! Isn’t that amazing!”“Dad, if the world is round, why don’t the people on the bottom fall off?”. . . and ended up on Saturn.” “Oh, they used to! A lot of people fell off. . .“But some people got caught in the branches of trees. They climbed up to the ground, and dug tunnels so they could get around without falling.”“Now they’ve built upsidedown houses, and they swing between them on ropes!”Tig is pretty sure someone is making things up.But that’s OK.	./Story text files/424.txt	931	16	5.545454545454546	87	12	88	27.242424242424242	25	8	17	6.242424242424242	23	10	65	34	4	1.0495867768595042	116	5

"Tulsa wishes she could visit a forest. Her teacher reads stories about tigers to the class. She loves to hear about forests and animals.One day, her wish comes true! Khare Chacha, a senior forest official, invites Tulsa and her friends to visit a forest called Kanha Tiger Reserve. Tulsa and her friends can’t stop grinning. They will go to the forest for a whole day and a whole night!It takes four hours by bus from the school to the forest. As soon as Tulsa gets down from the bus, a strong hand shakes her hand and then ruffles her hair. “Welcome to Kanha!” It is Khare Chacha.Tulsa and her friends Rani, Mithu, and Dipti stay close to one another. “Sniff the air. It smells of trees and leaves!” says Mithu. “The air is clean like it has been washed with soap!” adds Rani.It's almost sunset now. Khare Chacha and other forest officials tell them about the forest they will visit tomorrow. They play the sounds of animals and birds for the girls to hear and recognise.PIAON! PIAON! “It’s a peacock!” OOW! OOW! “I know! It’s a barking deer.” KEEE! KEE! “That is the sound of crickets!” Next day, Tulsa wakes up at five in the morning. Brrr! It’s cold! Everyone bundles up in warm clothes. One by one, they get into the bus. “All around us there is tall grass covered in a thick blanket of fog,” Ranveer Uncle, the forest guide, tells them. Tulsa can feel the cold and pure air in her mouth. It tastes like mint leaves.“Shhh!” Ranveer Uncle whispers. “There are two jackals right next to our bus.” Everyone listens carefully. They hear the rustling sound of the tall grass. Dried leaves crush under their feet, as the jackals run lightly into the dense forest.Ranveer Uncle whispers again. “A big deer called sambar is standing on the left side of the road. The deer is brown and has big stemlike horns called antlers on its head.” Everyone focuses to their left. HAUNNNNK! HAUNNNK! The sambar runs off. ""Sounds like a very big horn!” says Tulsa. All the girls laugh.Soon, the air becomes even cooler. “We are near a river now,” Ranveer Uncle says. Tulsa can hear the gurgling of the water. So many birds are calling from the trees.FHWEEE! FHWEEE! “That one is whistling!” says Rashmi. “Yes Rashmi, that is the call of a thrush,” says Ranveer Uncle. KEEECH! KEECH! “And that screeching you hear is the call of the jungle babbler.”Soft leaves fall from above. Baby monkeys are showering them with leaves! Tulsa picks up a leaf that falls on her. It smells fresh and pure, just like the forest.The bus starts moving uphill. “Hold this creeper. See how it feels like a strong rope? T he leaves are like cotton!” Everyone takes turns to hold the creeper. “This is the mahul,” says Ranveer Uncle. “The leaves are used to make small bowls.”PIAONN! PIAONN! “Peacock to your right!” Ranveer Uncle is excited.“Is he dancing?” asks Tulsa. “Yes!” Uncle says. “His feathers are shining in the winter sun and are sparking like gemstones.” “Beautiful,” says Tulsa.By now everyone is very hungry. They stop at the forest camp for breakfast. There, Khare Chacha announces a surprise. “Some of our camp elephants are here. They won’t mind if you touch them gently.” Everyone starts squealing in delight. Soon Tulsa is led to the elephant, Tara.The guide places her hand on Tara’s prickly stomach. Whoomp! Tulsa hears the sound of Tara’s feet moving. Tulsa can feel the powerful muscles under her hand. Trumpeting softly, Tara places her trunk in Tulsa’s hand, looking for food. Tulsa can’t stop smiling, as she feels the wet trunk. It's time to go back. On the way, they pass a gaur. “The gaur is chewing grass. The body is black but the bottoms of the legs are white. It looks like the gaur is wearing socks,” says Ranveer Uncle. Everyone laughs. Suddenly, the air is split by a call, deep and loud.AUHN! The call comes again. “The tiger is very far,” explains Ranveer Uncle. “But he has probably seen you and wants you to know that.”Sighing with happiness, Tulsa and her friends head out of the park. There are so many ways to experience the forest ! They can't wait to come back to Kanha Tiger Reserve.This is a real story In January , the Last Wilderness Foundation in association with the Kanha Forest Department conducted a camp for  visually impaired students from the Ananya Manav Sai Samiti, Jabalpur. The students were taken on a safari and nature trail using their fabulous sensory skills to enjoy the forest.About Last Wilderness Foundation The Last Wilderness Foundation is an NGO that works in urban and rural areas with children to spread awareness about wildlife and biodiversity, and sensitise them towards conservation and the environment.

"""There she is! "" Kallu pointed down the lane. ""Why is she so late today? Something must have happened in school, "" his younger brother Shabbo added worriedly. They had returned from school much earlier but their sister Munia was still not home, so lunch had to wait. As Munia came closer walking very slowly, dragging her school bag behind her, they noticed the flushed cheeks and the fiery glitter in her eyes.""Oye! She’s angry about something! "" Kallu mumbled under his breath and then turned to stare at Shabbo, ""Did you say something to her? "" ""Noooo… I don’t think so…"" Shabbo blinked nervously. ""Did you? "" ""Never! Are you mad? "" Everyone in the village of Khajuria knew about Munia’s hot temper. It was that famous. She did not lose it easily but when she did… baap re! Everyone knew about it really fast!According to Kallu when Munia was angry, the street dogs hid behind trees and the crows flew away to the next village. And now looking at her glittering eyes, he knew something had got her burning again. So he and Shabbo watched her very, very carefully as she marched into the house, muttering something under her breath.""That stupid man. . . sitting there like a nawab or something on his stupid charpai… who does he think he is? "" ""Who?” Kallu asked very carefully. ""You wouldn’t understand. You’re too stupid! """"Theek hai, "" he said meekly and followed her inside. You did not argue unnecessarily with Munia when she was in this dangerous mood. Once, when she was mad at their mother for making her cook, Kallu had tried to joke about it and she had whipped around and tried to bite him. Luckily, she only got a mouthful of his kurta, but with a quick toss of her head, she had torn off a piece! Kallu told his friend Damu that if she had actually drawn blood, he would have had to take injections like they do for dog bite. And when Munia heard what he had said, she threatened to bite him again. So who was this nawab on a charpai, Kallu wondered as he helped himself to another parantha. Who in the whole village had the suicidal courage to make Munia angry? The story came out during lunch after a few bites of parantha and vegetable had calmed Munia down.""One day…"" she said chewing away, “Mangu Mali’s precious tree will be struck by lightning… just you wait and see. I’ve cursed it today! "" ""Aaah! "" said Kallu and Shabbo together, everything was explained. ""You tried to get a mango again! ! "" ""Just one mango… I really begged you know… just the tiniest, smallest one.” Munia shook her head. ""And again he said…""""Come and get it from the Ambia Bhoot! "" Kallu and Shabbo said together. Everyone in Khajuria knew that the sweetest, juiciest, mangoes in the whole district grew on the tree in the corner of Mangu Mali’s orchard. Every summer, the branches would droop with large, palegreenand lemon coloured Dussehri mangoes, with that heavenly flavour that you could smell from far away. The problem was that Mangu would never allow anyone near his tree. And letting you taste a slice of a mango? Forget it! All day he sat on his charpai, smoking his hookah right in the shade of the tree and what was worse, he would look at the children, give his crooked smile behind his moustache and say, ""No one can steal my mangoes. All day I guard my tree, and all night I leave it to the Ambia Bhoot, the ghost of the mango tree. ""Then he would take a drag at his hookah, cough and laugh nastily showing his large yellow teeth, ""If anyone has the courage to face the deadly Ambia Bhoot and steal any mangoes, he can have them for free, heh heh! "" For years, all the kids in the village had dreamed of tasting a mango from the ‘bhoot tree’ but every mango stealing expedition had failed. No one had ever met the Ambia Bhoot but somehow Mangu Mali seemed to read their minds. Every time anyone crept into the orchard, there he was, waiting in the shadow of that dark leafy tree, smiling nastily behind his moustache. This time Mangu Mali had made a mistake. He had challenged Munia and her gang. Their gang included Kallu and his best friend Damu, studying in class nine.Kallu’s sister Munia and Damu’s sister Saru were both in class eight and Shabbo the youngest was in class seven. In the school register, Kallu was Kallan, Damu was Damodar, Munia was Munira, Saru was Saraswati and Shabbo was Shabbir, but even Masterji often forgot their real names. They were determined to get mangoes from the ‘bhoot tree’, as Damu called it. Only the prospect of a ghostly attack by Ambia Bhoot made them rather nervous. But they had taken Mangu Mali’s insults long enough and were determined that this summer, they had to defeat the Ambia Bhoot. As Saru said, their reputation as 'champion mango stealers' was at stake. According to Mangu Mali, the Ambia Bhoot lived right there among those dark leafy branches. All day while Mangu Mali sat under the tree on his charpai, Ambia Bhoot slept somewhere out of sight. But all night, he could be heard moving from branch to branch making these horrible, hissing and gargling noises and counting the mangoes.And he got very, very angry if he found that any mango was missing. Then, if he caught anyone trying to steal his mangoes, he attacked them by turning into coils of poisonous smoke that strangled the thief to death!Mangu Mali said no one could be so brave or so stupid to face the terrible Ambia Bhoot and stay alive. And that was why he slept peacefully in his bed every night because he knew that no one could ever get those mangoes for free. That evening, the gang meeting was held at the run down pillared hall behind the temple. Once upon a time, this open hall was a sort of village clubhouse where people met in the evenings to chat. But nowadays all the men preferred to gather at Dharampal’s chai shop, sipping tea in tiny glasses and munching his hot samosas and pakoras. So Kallu and his gang had taken over the hall and Saru and Shabbo had even painted some crazy pictures on one wall. They all knew it was going to be quite a challenge.It was the toughest mango stealing expedition they had ever planned, and the enemies were very powerful. After all, to fool both Mangu Mali and the dangerous Ambia Bhoot was no joke! So they planned the whole expedition very, very carefully. ""I’ve read somewhere that ghosts hate to come out in the moonlight, "" Kallu said. ""So we’ll go tomorrow night when it’s full moon. "" ""And I’ll carry some garlic, "" said Damu. ""A mango bhoot used to the heavenly aroma of Dussehris would hate the smell. """"There must be some special bhoot prayers, "" Saru wondered thoughtfully, ""may be Moti Dadi would know some, I’ll ask her. "" Moti Dadi was Damu and Saru’s grandmother and she was always making dark brown, horribletasting potions for coughs and stomach aches. So if anyone knew about antibhoot mantras, it would be her. ""Do you think I should carry my lucky marble? "" Shabbo asked a little nervously. ""It helps me during the maths tests. "" ""Garlic? Marble? Hah! ! I’ll carry my biggest stick,” said Munia grimly.""Stick? What for? "" they all asked together. ""If the moonlight, prayers, marble and the garlic don’t work, "" said Munia with a steely glitter in her eyes, ""I’ll beat the silly bhoot to a pulp. "" ""Don’t be silly! "" laughed Kallu, ""a bhoot is like a smoky cloud with sharp teeth and lo. . o. . ong, pointy nails. You can’t beat up a bhoot, Munia. "" Munia gave a superior sniff, swung her pigtails and walked away.That night they waited until everyone was asleep and then crept out of their beds and tiptoed towards the orchard. Kallu looked up at the bright moon and sighed in relief. Damu’s kurta pocket had a handful of garlic, while Saru was trying to remember that really 'tried andtested' antibhoot prayer that Moti Dadi had taught her.Shabbo, who had forgotten to bring his magic marble was already in a panic, and ready to run the moment the Ambia Bhoot appeared. Munia took a deep breath and clutched the thick bamboo stick that she used when taking the goats to graze in the fields. As they moved swiftly through the orchard, they kept a sharp ear for Mangu Mali who slept in his small house across the nullah. The house was dark and Mangu Mali was clearly asleep.Hearts thudding, they crept towards the ‘bhoot tree’. Getting closer, they listened carefully. The orchard was bathed in silvery moonlight with patches of looming shadows and it was absolutely silent. Except for the drone of the mosquitoes around their heads, not even a bird called or a bat flew about. The silence was really scary. Where was Ambia Bhoot?Obviously he wasn’t counting his mangoes tonight or you’d have heard him slithering around the branches, hissing, ""Ek… do… teen… pandrah…"" Kallu was the best tree climber among them and he specialized in mango trees. So the plan was that he’d climb up, quickly pick a few mangoes from the lower branches, drop them to Munia and Damu waiting below and slide down fast before Ambia Bhoot could spot him. Saru was stationed at the gate of the mango orchard keeping watch, and was going to whistle if she saw Mangu Mali come out of his house. And Shabbo just hung at the back, his knees shaking, ready to run. Catching hold of the lower branches, Kallu clambered quickly to the nearest branch that was laden with mangoes. Then just as he reached out to break a fruit, there was a funny thin cough from above and a hissing voice came floating down, ""Who’s there? Who’s that? Who’s thaaaat? ""Kallu froze, as below the tree Damu carefully reached into his pocket, pulled out the garlic and waved it in the air. ""Go away! Go awaaay! ! "" hissed Ambia Bhoot, as Kallu crouched on the branch ready to spring down, ""I am coming… I am coming…"" ""Kallu! Are you alive? "" quavered Damu from below.""I will get you! I will get you! ! "" hissed Ambia Bhoot, making these weird gargling noises. Munia clutched her stick harder, looked up into the dark branches and asked, ""Why do you repeat yourself like that, Ambia Bhoot? We’re not deaf! "" There was a surprised silence from Ambia and then with a crackling of branches, a scary, greywhite thing came slipping quickly down the tree, making these horrible groaning noises, ""I’ll eat you! I’ll eat you! ! "" ""RUN! ! ! "" yelled Damu and instantly Shabbo and Saru streaked out of the orchard at super speed and headed for home. Damu, about to follow them, turned and tripped over a hole in the ground, and went sprawling to the ground and lay there all dazed and breathless.Kallu slid down the tree as fast as he could, dropping into a heap under the tree, leaving his chappals behind. Then as Ambia Bhoot’s sinister shadow got closer and closer, Kallu and Damu scrambled up and turned to flee. ""Munia! "" yelled Damu. ""RUN! ! "" The dark, scary shadow, hissing, gargling and groaning was getting closer and closer… when Munia clenched her teeth, raised her big stick and hit Ambia Bhoot with a loud 'Thwack! ' and then a 'Phataack! ! ' ""OW! "" yelled Ambia in surprise, ""OOOF! "" Kallu and Damu already halfway down the orchard slid to a halt in utter surprise. Who was that? Did Ambia Bhoot say, ""Ooof! ""?Then Munia hit Ambia Bhoot again. ""Bachao! "" yelled the voice of Mangu Mali as he scrambled down from the tree in panic and dropped the sheet he’d wrapped around himself. ""Stop hitting me Munia. That hurts! """"Now who’s the bhoot? Who’s the bhoot? "" mimicked Munia, dancing around him in triumph, still waving her stick. ""Theek hai, "" said Mangu Mali with a cough. ""You win! Pick some mangoes…"" ""Pick some mangoes! Pick some mangoes! "" repeated a grinning Munia, Kallu and Damu after him as they began to climb the tree. ""Saru and Shabbo ran away, did they? "" asked Munia, busy picking mangoes. ""They missed all the fun.

"Meera lives in a small village. It is right on top of a mountain in Himachal Pradesh. From her kitchen window, she can see snowcapped mountains. Huge eagles with golden wings often fly over their house. One day, when she is older and taller, Meera wishes to climb up to the highest peak and look down at the other side.But today, Meera, her brother Rajesh, and Ma are walking downhill. They are going to the market to buy new shoes. The town is far but Meera does not mind. She walks an hour every day to go to school. They set out at dawn. They have to walk for two hours to reach the main road. Then they will take the bus.Sometimes, the path disappears and they slide down the rocks. “Whee!” say Meera and Rajesh as they jump over the stones.Crunch crunch, go the twigs and dry leaves under their feet. ""Cree . . ckrr. . ckre! "" a small green barbet calls from the shrubs. A gang of langurs watch them quietly from the pine trees.Meera stops to drink water from a spring hidden behind rocks and ferns. Suddenly, she sees a little bird. It is lying in the ferns. “Poor thing. He has injured his wing,” says Ma. She gently picks up the bird. “Should we take him with us?” asks Meera. The bird is a spotted forktail. The bird watches them with his tiny eyes. He is scared. “Do not worry,” Meera tells him softly.“First I must mend the wing,” says Ma. They put some wet earth on the wing and wrap the bird in a big leaf. Meera puts the bird in her cloth bag.On the main road, the bus has just arrived. In the bus, Meera can feel the bird moving about in her bag. “Maybe he is hungry,” says Ma. “So am I,” says Rajesh. They eat some roasted gram. Meera crushes a few and gives it to the bird. The old bus rumbles along on the winding mountain road.The town is noisy and crowded. “Stay close to me, Meera and Rajesh!” Ma calls. They hold hands tightly.When they reach the market, they buy Meera’s shoes. Ma also buys some hot jalebis for them from the sweet shop. Meera gives the bird a tiny piece but he does not like it. He instead tries to peck at the cloth bag.Soon it is time to take the bus to go back home. As the bus sways from side to side, Meera can hear the little bird chirping in her bag. “We will soon be at the spring,” Meera whispers to the bird. When they reach the spring, Meera lets him out. He hops a bit, drinks some water and then sits on Meera’s feet. The bird likes the new shoes, too!It is almost dark when they get home. Meera makes a soft bed with some straw for the bird. The bird goes to sleep in his new bed.Meera and the bird become good friends. Meera gives him tiny rice and chana balls to eat. After a week, the bird suddenly flies away.Now, every time Meera walks down the hill, she sees a black and white bird with a long tail. The bird always nods and chirps at her. Do you think he is the same bird?"	./Story text files/248.txt	2834	14	5.154340836012862	281	30	116	40.08695652173913	47	22	25	8.985507246376812	31	38	207	104	4	1.1580381471389645	356	11

"Once upon a time there was a little girl called Ramya. Ramya loved earrings. Everybody who gave her gifts, gave her earrings.

Then, for Ramya's birthday, do you know what her Grandma got her?Grandma got Ramya really pretty diamond earrings that looked like stars! Ramya loved them. ""Oh! Grandma, from where did you get such pretty diamond stars? "" she asked.It was a starless night, and Grandma pointed to the sky. ""See, there are no stars in the sky any longer.

'Ah. . . this looks perfect! ' Kakai exclaimed as she flew over the Teak tree. She had spotted the perfect place to make a nest. Our babies will be safe here! ' she said to Kaka with a smile.Using her beak and claws, Kakai collected twigs and dry leaves and gathered them at the spot. With her beak, she sewed them all together to make a home for her chicks. It was tiring work but she would not rest until her job was done. When the nest was ready, Kakai laid her eggs inside it and sat over the eggs to keep them warm. 'Soon, they will hatch and my babies will be out! ' Kakai thought.One day, Kakai was very thirsty and decided to fly out to the little pond nearby to drink some water. 'I must get back quickly' she thought to herself as she flew out. 'It is not safe to leave the nest for long. 'A Koel sitting on a tree nearby had been closely watching Kakai's nest for a long time. When Kakai flew out to drink water, the Koel sensed that it was the right time. Swiftly she flew down to Kakai's nest and laid her egg inside it. Before Kakai could return, the Koel was gone.After having a few sips of water, Kakai quickly returned to her nest. Examining the nest, she was happy to see that the eggs were safe inside. Anxious about the safety of her chicks, she had not realised that, there was one more egg inside the nest.After a few days, the first egg cracked open and a little baby emerged. 'My beautiful babies! ' Kakai smiled as she watched the other eggs crack open one by one. Slowly each of the eggs hatched open and the little babies made their way out. Kakai watched over them all, cleaning them with her beak and making them feel loved.'This little one looks slightly different from the rest, don't you think? Kaka asked Kakai one day, looking down at the little koel baby. 'Well, perhaps it is, ' Kakai replied looking down at the little one. 'But how does it matter? ' she asked. 'After all, it is Love that makes a family! 'Helpless and unable to fly, the chicks depended on their parents for food. Sometimes, Kaka and Kakai found insects and worms for the babies. At other times rice or dosas that people left out on their window sill to feed birds. Putting their beaks into their babies' mouths, the parents fed each of them one by one.Soon, the little chicks had grown and could look after themselves. Ready to fly out into the world, they bade their parents goodbye. 'Take care little ones! ' Kakai said to her babies. 'We are no longer little! ' one of her children laughed.Kakai realised the children were eager to fly out. 'Well, to us, you shall always remain our babies! ' Kakai said to the children as they bid goodbye and flew away.Kaka and Kakai watched, as their children flew out of the nest one by one, to begin their new lives. Feeling a gentle tug at his heart, Kaka said turning to Kakai, 'My dear, I now understand what you once told me. . . It is Love that makes a Family!

"""Again! Stack them up again, Bonda! I want to try knocking them down from a different angle! "" Without hesitating for a moment, without even frowning, Bonda puts one battered box on top of the other for the fiftieth time. The high, shaky, cardboard tower is perfectly balanced, the way only Bonda knows how to build it.I rev up my superspeedy turbo engine – vrooom, VROOM – and gun for it, coming in from the right this time. BAM! I crash through, shrieking with delight, as the tower explodes around me. Bonda laughs, clapping as loudly as he did the first time I did this. Dear Bonda. The best, most loyal friend anyone could have. Especially a yearold in a wheelchair.Hi. I'm Devi, and I'm from the year  AD. My grandfather is always going on about how much the world has changed since he was my age, back in . It's more crowded now, but the air, thankfully, is less polluted, because a great many vehicles now run on electricity or solar power. There are fewer accidents too, because vehicles drive themselves, and they are very careful. There are fewer trees and forests than there used to be, but more are being planted all the time, which is good. But what has REALLY changed, says my grandfather, is technology. There was technology way back in  too, but nothing like what we have now. it has truly made life wonderful. Well, MY life, anyway. It was technology that gave me my best friend.Meet Bonda. Best friend forever, cardboardtower builder, and ROBOT. I see your eyes pop. Ha! You hadn't guessed that, had you? But think about it. Which other friend would cheerfully build you a tower  times over without complaining? And which other friend would build it so perfectly every single time? Bonda: I agree! Humans are simply not as accurate or as consistent as we are. And they complain that doing the same thing over and over is “boring” (I've no idea what that word means, so don't ask me! ). And they fall ill, and need to go to the toilet a lot. I wonder how they got anything done before we arrived!Building towers is not all Bonda can do, though. I can train him to do many other things – bowl me two dozen fast balls in ten minutes so that I can practise my batting, bring down my secret treasure box from the topmost shelf (which is so high that no one else can reach it without a ladder), lift Baba's heavy desk so I can see where my tiny gold earring has rolled off to (Ma would yell at me for hours if I lost it). . . Things like that.Bonda: Like I said, humans are quite useless compared to us robots. The poor things are stuck at their sad little heights, while we can grow taller and shorter at will, by extending or collapsing our arms and legs. Our eyes can be cameras, telescopes, microscopes, or all three rolled into one!How do I train Bonda? By “programming” him. Programming means showing him, just once, how something's done. For instance, the other day, I wanted him to bring me my secret treasure box, the one I talked about earlier. Here's how I did it. First, I directed Bonda to the shelf it was sitting on, drawing the route on the plan of my house he displays on his touchscreen. “Can you reach up and scan the top shelf now, B?” I said when he got there. His arm shot out and up. As he ran his hand along the length of the shelf, the tiny camera inside his finger clicked away, taking pictures of everything there.When he showed me those pictures, I simply touched the picture of the box I wanted. ""That's my secret treasure box, Bonda, "" I said. ""Can you bring it down for me? "" Now, whenever I need the box, I only have to say, ""Secret treasure box! "" and off he goes, straight to the shelf. Once he has “learnt” something, Bonda never forgets. His memory is fantastic! Bonda: Fantastic? Only to incompetent humans, who can never remember where they left their keys, their glasses, their phones. . .Yeah, that's what my best friend's like. And yeah, I am a very lucky girl indeed. Oh, don't get me wrong – I'm not weird. I do have human friends who I play with and fight with and go to school with. But I love Bonda more than all of them, because he doesn't sulk when I have fun with someone else, or get jealous when I beat him at maths, or mad when I forget to wish him on his birthday. . . Psst! And this is because. . . Bonda has no feelings! But don't say that out loud – it might make him feel bad.Bonda: Tsk, tsk, Devi, where's your logical thinking, girl? You say I don't have feelings, and then you worry that I will “feel bad” . Humans can be logical, but when they ""feel"" sad, or mad, or scared, logic disappears! Pah! Who needs feelings? Wait! Was that a “feeling” I felt just now? My processor tells me it was. It tells me I am feeling something called “disgust” . . . Hmm. . . I don't know how to “feel” about that.Oh, and here's the best part – I never have to feel bad that he's having fun with another friend instead of me, because. . . he doesn't have any! Bonda: Hey, hey, that's not true – I do have other friends! The robot waitress at the cafe always says “Hello” nicely, and so does the robot checkout boy at the grocery store. . . Wait a minute. . . I've just processed what Devi has been saying. . . she only likes me BECAUSE I have no other friends – AND no feelings! Not because of who I am! Oh no! I feel a rush of feels – I'm feeling mad, and sad, and. . .""Bonda! Are you okay? You're overheating, Bonda – you have a fever! And your auto shutdown is not working! ""But don't worry, my friend, I will take care of you like you have always taken care of me. Listen carefully now, Bonda – I'm going to shut you down now so that your system can recover, ok? Don't be scared – it will be like going to sleep, that's all. And when I start you up again, you'll be back, good as new, and we will be best friends again. Do you hear me? "" Bonda: Devi's eyes are all wet, like they are when she is sad, or scared. That makes me feel a sad feel. But my processor tells me that her wet eyes mean that she really cares about me. Now I feel a happy feel. . . So confused. . . sad andhappy. . . happyandsad. . . And shutting dowww. . .There is a whirr and a hum as Bonda reboots. I fight back my tears. ""Bonda? "" I say. ""Bonda, can you hear me? Do you know who I am? Please tell me your memory isn't wiped out! I want you to remember all the fun we've had this past year, all the love. . . ""Bonda: Aha! Love. Was that the feel I was feeling, that happyandsad feel?Bonda looks at me. ""Hi Devi! What would you like me to do for you today? Shall we play StacktheBoxes? Shall I bring you your secret treasure box? Do you want to. . . "" ""Bonda! You're all right! Oh, I'm glad, glad, GLAD! "" I throw my arms around Bonda and hug him tight.Bonda: And then I do something really odd, something no one has ever programmed me to do. I wrap my arms around my friend Devi, for no logical reason at all.ROBOTS: YESTERDAY, TODAY AND TOMORROW Will there be a Bonda for every Devi by the year ? We'll have to wait and see, but there is no denying that robots will be far more visible even in  years from now, by the year . Who or what is a robot? If you said a robot is a machine that looks and acts like a human, except it moves jerkily, has a flat, expressionless voice, and eyes that flash when it is turned on, you've obviously been watching too many movies and TV shows. Because, actually, a robot is “any electromechanical machine guided by a computer program or electronic circuits"". Yup, it doesn't have to look like a human at all. Which is why you may not have realised that there are robots all around us, already! Really? Where? Well, they are in factories, warehouses, orchards, hospitals and even homes. They may look like large mechanical arms, like the ones in car manufacturing plants, welding, gluing and painting car parts. Or they may look like tiny cameras, like the ones in hospitals, attached to thin hairlike tubes, entering our intestines and arteries to check them out for problems. Some robots look like flat round discs, working in homes and offices, buzzing around and cleaning floors at night when everyone is asleep. Some look like small wheeled vehicles, going into war zones, finding dangerous landmines, or rolling across the surfaces of the moon or Mars, taking pictures and collecting samples to send to scientists back on Earth.I wish I could see a robot for myself! If you have ever used, or even seen, a computer or a smartphone, you have 'seen' a robot! Yes, they are in those devices as well. Some of them even have names, like Siri and Cortana (have you heard of them? ). They can help us find useful information  stuff for school projects, traffic reports (which roads have heavy traffic today? What is a good alternative route to take? ), entertainment (where is the new Deepika Padukone movie running? And when is the next show? ), and much more. They can even book our bus and train tickets, order our groceries, and tell us exactly how many calories we have burnt after a game of football. What does the future of robots look like? What will the world really be like by, say, , as far as robots are concerned? We may not have robots walking our streets in India by , but we will definitely be surrounded by robots of one kind or another without knowing it. It is quite likely that there will be driverless “robot” cars on our streets. We may have microscopic robots in our contact lenses that help us take pictures – we won't even have to hold our phones or cameras up to take them (but how will we take selfies? ? ). And little airborne robots called drones will be flying busily all around – delivering letters, packages and kababs, putting delivery boys out of business, and hopefully reducing some traffic on our streets! As for ,  years AFTER that, who knows what robots will be up to?"	./Story text files/152.txt	9775	17	5.454634146341464	830	195	371	47.1576354679803	129	74	79	10.123152709359607	107	96	585	440	7	1.3372781065088757	1041	142
Fatima loved Sunday afternoons. After a lunch of beans and kofta, Maa would read the newspaper on her favourite chair and Baba would sneak away to take a nap.Fatima could patter away with her book into the lively green forest near her house. The forest creatures would be sleeping, so it would be just her, curled up in the quiet hug of the forest trees.Fatima would sit down in the shade of the Arjuna tree and gaze into the leafy Up World. Maa had warned her not to climb the tree’s branches. It was safe down below. Fatima didn’t know what was in the scary Up World. But that day, Fatima was in for a surprise. As she turned a page, Fatima felt a dull THUMP! on her head. “Ouch!” she yelled, rubbing her sore head. It was a tiny book, barely the size of a pea.Fatima looked up and saw a furry animal trying to hide behind a bough of leaves. “Hello! Is this book yours?” she asked, peering into the Up World. But she got no answer.The peasized book belonged to Gopa, a young dormouse who lived in the Up World. Gopa’s little house, made of soft dry leaves and twigs, was in the Arjuna tree as well. The dormouse had often seen Fatima reading, and loved the yellow ribbons in her hair.But Gopa’s Amma had warned her about the terrors of the Down World. All the animals were fearful of Fatima and other human beings and tried to remain invisible to the Down World.That Sunday, Gopa had been swinging on her green, leafy hammock and reading. She was about to turn the last page when a strong breeze blew the book out of her small, furry paws. Down it went! It bounced on the branches and floated away. The book fell THWACK! and hit Fatima on her head. Gopa’s tail quivered and ears twitched. The Up and Down World should never meet, she thought and bolted home.Fatima didn’t climb the tree but kept squinting and trying to read the book. The letters were too small! Finally, she decided to return the book to the shadowy, furry creature. Fatima was really clever – next Sunday she tied five shiny, red balloons around her waist and suddenly, she was floating up. To the Up World! Up, Up, and Up went Fatima, until she reached the tree tops.Gopa was brushing her bushy tail when she spotted five, shiny red balloons! “Oh, balloons! Maybe it is someone’s birthday,” she thought excitedly. But what was this? There was the girl with the yellow ribbons attached to the shiny, red balloons. “Run, run away!” squeaked Gopa, “The Down World humans are here!”But Fatima was faster. Fatima offered Gopa the book and asked, “Is this yours?” Gopa grabbed the book quickly and smiled. Fatima giggled. She caught Gopa staring at her ribbons and tied one in a neat bow around her tail. Fatima and Gopa held hands and went off exploring!Fatima and Gopa ran and skipped over the gaps in the trees of the canopy forest. They bugged Baankey the fruit bat, who was sleeping upside down. Baankey did not like being poked. He grunted grumpily, and flapped away to the next branch. “These kids will never let me rest,” he thought. Soon he was away in Dreamsville, where he was hanging out in a fig tree, biting into the fleshy, sweet fruits.Gopa helped Fatima hop over the long lines of weaver ants who were too busy to even stop and say hello. With long spindly legs and bubbleshaped bodies, the weaver ants scampered all over the tree. These ants love teams! They work together to stitch large leaves into cozy nests.Next, they bumped into Firki the canopy frog. “He looks like a rainbow,” thought Fatima. “Yellow feet, red eyes, and a blue body!” Firki was so surprised to see a human in his canopy that he almost let go of his strong grip on the branch! He croaked a weak hello and turned to pounce on his lunch – a grasshopper! “I thought only the Down World had frogs,” said Fatima, who loved chasing frogs around her house pond.Hari the Hornbill was watching them from a distance. He really wanted to be friends with them! Hari was a friendly bird but he made very loud noises, which is why some animals kept him at a distance. But Gopa and Fatima didn’t mind at all.“The Up World isn’t so scary after all,” thought Fatima. “How silly I was.” “The people from the Down World are pretty cool,” thought Gopa. “I am not frightened anymore.”“Sob! Sniff.” “Uh, oh, I think Vaidya is crying,” said Gopa. Her sharp ears picked up sounds easily. The two friends hurried towards Vaidya, a green vine snake, who was very shy.“What is wrong, Vaidya?” asked Gopa. Vaidya sobbed, looking greener than usual. “They cut down the tree that was my home. Now I don’t know where to go,” he cried. Baankey, Dipu and other animals also popped out of their homes. Vaidya was homeless. “A new, concrete road is going to be built and humans cut down my tree,” wailed Vaidya. Cutting down their home! The Up World was alarmed and upset.“We must help Vaidya,” said Gopa. Fatima, Gopa and their new friends formed a search party. They searched and searched and found a snug treehole home for Vaidya. Fatima layered the home with soft leaves and orange flowers, Vaidya’s favourite colour. Vaidya loved his new home. “I can’t believe I have so many friends! We need to have a party,” he said.And what a party it was. Everyone got their favourite food. Gopa got nuts, Hari got fruits, Baankey was too sleepy to get anything, the ants brought homestitched, leafy cushions to sit on! Nobody wanted Firki’s grasshoppers. As for Fatima, she had to get the balloons. For the first time ever, the Up World and the Down World were just One World.Meet Fatima’s Friends in the Up World Gopa and her friends live in the vast forest canopies of India. That means they don’t live in the Down World, like us human beings. Instead they live in the Up World, in the swinging branches and swaying leaves of trees. Many creatures that live in forest canopies are now used to living in tree tops. If you’re lucky you will spot some of them, but most of these animals know how to hide themselves cleverly. So you have to be patient! When scientists go to learn about these canopies, they have to use ropes or ladders, because the trees are very tall. Some even use very large hotair balloons to get up there. You can imagine just how Up Fatima had to go with her balloons.Here are some of the animals who living in forest canopies: Malabar spiny dormouse: This bushytailed animal likes to live in trees in quiet, undisturbed forests. It loves to eat fruits and nibbles on pepper sometimes. This dormouse sleeps like a hedgehog, curled up with its tail protruding OUT. Hornbill: These birds are vividly coloured with long and strong beaks. These sociable birds love to eat fruits, insects and even small animals. They make nests in holes in trees and when they have babies, they make a mud wall to cover up the hole, much like making a house!Green vine snake: A bright green, slender tree snake that hides in the leaves of a canopy. It moves very slowly. You can find them not only in India but also Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. Tree frog: There are several kinds of tree frogs and they come in various colours. They can have white lips or red or yellow eyes and brown feet. They are usually very small, half the size of your palm, because they have to jump around delicate branches. They spend most of their lives up in the trees. Fruit bat (aka Megabat): They hang upside down. Try to imagine what the world looks like to them! They love to eat fruits and being busy in the trees. They can be super noisy too. You can hear them from a long way off. They have keen senses of sight and smell and are very helpful to us because they pollinate the flowers and fruits we love.	./Story text files/132.txt	7640	16	5.7360406091370555	662	126	160	56.88636363636363	64	68	28	11.5	45	87	454	334	4	1.4475446428571428	792	104
When Loco, the lovely new train was rolled into the railway shed, all the older trains admired its fine face and figure. “Oh, you will soon go to all kinds of strange and new places. What wonderful adventures you will have!” they promised. But Loco did not want any adventures — it was, you see, a frightened little train — not little at all, of course, but it was so scared of everything that it felt tiny!It didn't want to leave the railway shed. It shrank when the cows in the fields bellowed, but felt comforted by the friendly, older trains around. It was scared even when a dog ran barking towards it, and wished it could hide somewhere safer! But how was it to hide anywhere, and how could it always stay in the shed?A wise old train who had been all over the country saw how frightened Loco looked, and pointed out that it was much bigger than dogs and cows. But Loco was not sure. “Oh, but they are all so strong and fierce. I don’t want to go anywhere alone,” it said. So the old train said, “But you won’t be alone, dear Loco. The engine driver and the guard will be with you.”Loco knew the guard. He was a pleasant fellow who waved the flag when trains had to leave. Loco saw that he was quite small. It didn't think the guard could protect it from anything. Loco also knew the engine driver Babu and it trusted his kind face.Soon the big day arrived when Loco was rolled out of the yard for its maiden journey. Loco was to go all the way across from Tamil Nadu near the sea to Jammu next to the mountains. Babu, the engine driver pushed some buttons, and twisted some knobs, and off chugged Loco from the station, its heart in its mouth.“Oooo,” it cried in fright but what do you suppose happened? It came out sounding exactly like a sharp train whistle! Some mynahs pecking nearby quickly flew off cackling. And as it thundered on, off flew all the crows and sparrows and other birds perched on wires along the railway track in great fright. Loco was really surprised that anybody could be frightened of it, and laughed.At once, the ground shuddered, and dogs nearby took to their heels! Soon Loco was far from its home. Seeing a big bull sitting on the track, Loco was so scared that it let out a piercing shriek, “Oooo!” And the bull lifted its tail and sprang away, its legs flaying about wildly as it ran for dear life.Loco could hardly believe that such a big, powerful creature could be afraid of it, a mere train! It felt much braver and decided that now it wouldn't even fear lions and tigers. But guess where Loco had to go next?Deep inside a dark cave in the mountains. Babu, the driver didn’t even flinch as he merrily punched some buttons to switch on the engine lights, but Loco was horrified. “Noooo, I don’t want to go in there,” it wailed, but it just came out as a great long whistle. Through the deep cavern hurtled dear Loco, its great beams lighting the pitch black tunnel.When it emerged on the other side, it let out a big sigh of relief “Oooo!” It came out as another long whistle of course, but then, it was never afraid of anything anymore.Now Loco chugs merrily across fields and over bridges, over mountains and through forests, whistling when it feels happy, and to tell everyone else to move out of its way. Have you taken a trip on Loco?	./Story text files/493.txt	3281	13	5.637724550898204	285	49	170	73.5909090909091	14	30	35	14.863636363636363	10	34	208	126	4	1.4594594594594594	335	35
Una, the mountain goat, lived in Sakuland. Sakuland was a wonderful country. It stretched from the shores of the sea to the forests, from the valleys to the mountain.The animals loved Sakuland. There was grass for the rabbits and the deer, insects for the birds and the bears to snack on, and fish for the crocodiles and wild cats. There was clear, cool water for everyone.Una lived high above the others, on top of a mountain. The climb up and down the rocky mountain trails was long and difficult. She didn’t spend too much time with the other animals, and got used to being alone. She rather liked it – she could do whatever she wanted, whenever she wanted. Sometimes Una thought that the others were a bit silly. Why do they always have to do everything together? Can’t they go to the stream by themselves? I do, thought Una. All the animals had ways they liked to do things. But Una thought her ways were the best.Slowly, Sakuland’s climate began to change, but the animals weren’t really paying attention. One day, the whales who spent most of the year in Sakuland’s waters announced that they were going to live someplace else.“Why?” asked the turtles. “It’s quite nice here.” “The water has become a bit too warm for us,” said the whales. “We will have to go further north where it’s cooler.” The whales liked to live in cool waters and Sakuland’s water was now too warm.The turtles would miss the beautiful songs sung by the whales. But they didn’t think too much about it. At least I’m okay, the turtles thought. “Picky, picky,” muttered Una to herself. “I don’t mind if it’s too hot or cold! They should be more like me.” Everyone soon forgot about the whales. But one day, the turtles started to pack up and leave. “Why?” asked the wild cats. “You always seemed happy here.” “There’s hardly enough sand left for us,” said the turtles, who laid their eggs on the sandy beach. “Where did it go?” asked the wild cats. “All we know is that the sand used to reach to the big rock,” said the big, old turtle. “But the big rock doesn’t look so big now – the water has almost covered it.” Too bad for the turtles. But at least I’m okay, thought the wild cats.Una saw the turtles leave and thought, What difference does it make to me if the sand disappears under water? The turtles should have been smart like me when deciding where to live. Una went looking for some grass to snack on and forgot about the whole matter.Then the wild cats left. They couldn’t catch nice fish anymore in the stream. It had become just a trickle. The deer thought, Oh, how terrible for the wild cats. But at least I’m okay. Una looked over at the stream where she drank. “The wild cats are pretty tough, but they must not be as tough as me.”One day, Una noticed something strange. Every year, the snow on her mountain would melt, just like an ice cube, and fill up her stream. But now there was less snow. Una wasn’t quite certain and thought, Maybe it just looks that way today.But then strange animals began to come to Sakuland. Everyone tried to be friendly to the cows. But the newcomers didn’t take much notice – they kept munching the grass and chewing it and chewing it some more. And there were so many of them!The deer were not too happy when the grass began to disappear. Slowly, the deer had to go outside Sakuland to find enough of the grass they liked. Hmmm. . . they should see what I have to eat at times, thought Una. Sometimes I have to lick the lichens on rocks. Not pleasant at all. Una stayed on her mountain as long as she could, but she often found herself, without enough to eat or drink.Finally, hungry and thirsty, Una climbed down the difficult mountain path. She tasted some of the grass from the hills, but it wasn’t the kind she liked. She found a stream in a valley, but the water’s taste was not as crisp as she was used to. Now Una realised why the other animals had left – it’s very important to eat the food that suits you best and have water nearby.The animals she knew had left Sakuland when they couldn’t find their favourite food easily, or when they were too thirsty because the stream had slowed down to a muddy trickle, or when their home trees were cut down to build homes for others. Una and her friends thought at least it’s not me when changes affected someone else. As the oceans became warmer, the whales left in search for a more suitable home. The turtles, the deer, and Una couldn’t care less. But later, they had to admit now it IS me. Una had to admit that having friends nearby is a necessity. She was determined to go find the others.At least it’s not me Una and her friends who live in Sakuland are facing climate change, just like we are. Human beings are burning more and more Green Houses Gases (GHG) – there’s carbon dioxide from coal and oil. Carbon dioxide is also released when we cut trees, then methane which cows that live in farms burp out, and nitrous oxides from cars and other vehicles. These Green House Gases are added to the atmosphere and that is causing global warming and changing the climate. As more heat is trapped in the atmosphere by the GHGs, the ice in the poles is melting and sea levels are rising. All of that means that the weather is becoming more unpredictable – it’s cold in the summer and warm in the winter, and the rains don’t come on time, like they used to. And that is climate change.Because of Climate Change… When forests are cut down, they add to the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere. Animals also lose their homes, the forest, and they have to go to faroff places in search of food. Farmers are not able to grow their crops properly because of erratic rainfall. Often, they sow the seeds but there’s no rain, and their crops fail. Imagine a world without mango or chocolate because there was no rain or too much rain and the crop failed! Unpredictable weather also affects human beings. For example, during storms, floods, or droughts, people lose their homes. The pollution in the atmosphere affects our health and we fall ill more often.	./Story text files/53.txt	6028	14	5.6683250414593696	499	104	241	61.802083333333336	42	54	44	12.5	31	65	380	223	4	1.4237037037037037	605	70

Then it was Chicken's turn to defend the goal.Millipede kicked the ball and scored. Millipede dribbled the ball and scored. Millipede headed the ball and scored. Millipede scored five goals!Chicken was furious that she lost. She was a very bad loser. Millipede started laughing because his friend was making such a fuss.Chicken was so angry that she opened her beak wide and swallowed Millipede.As Chicken was walking home, she met Mother Millipede. Mother Millipede asked, “Have you seen my child?” Chicken didn't say anything. Mother Millipede was worried.Then Mother Millipede heard a tiny voice. “Help me mom!” cried the voice. Mother Millipede looked around and listened carefully. The voice came from inside the chicken.Mother Millipede shouted, “Use your special power my child!” Millipedes can make a bad smell and a terrible taste. Chicken began to feel ill.Chicken burped. Then she swallowed and spat. Then she sneezed and coughed. And coughed. Millipede tasted disgusting!Chicken coughed until she coughed out Millipede. Mother Millipede and her child crawled up a tree to hide.From that time, all chickens and millipedes were enemies.	./Story text files/48.txt	1583	18	6.787096774193548	105	50	74	38.6	30	10	15	7.2	28	12	75	80	4	1.6096256684491979	154	33

Bzzz…Hey, what’s all that buzz about? Is it a code word used by bees to call their friends? Or a hum of excitement when honey is spotted?Bees, particularly bumble bees, make a loud buzzing sound as they fly. The sound is made when the wings beat up and down. The smaller the wings, the faster the bees have to beat them in order to fly. And the quicker they beat, the louder the buzz.Bees also buzz to do something very useful; they carry pollen from one flower to the other like a postman delivering letters.Pollen is the powdery grain on flowers. Pollen helps plants to make seeds. Bees are excellent pollinators. Thanks to them, many new plants grow and sprout all around.How do those tiny grains of pollen stick to the bees' feet? When bees sit on a flower to suck honey, the grains of pollen stick to their feet and bodies.Then when the same bees buzz near a flower and perform a lively dance, the quivering shakes the pollen off on other flowers. The bees then fly to other flowers where they leave the pollen behind to pick up new ones and this process continues.Bees are the buzzing godfathers of many new plants that grow away from the parenttree.Can you hear your own breath? Usually not. But you can hear a bee breathing. That is because the buzz is also the sound of the bee breathing. It has a small, segmented body so when it breathes, the air gets on a roller coaster ride through all those bumpy parts inside and creates a buzz. Sounds pretty exciting, doesn’t it? Aren’t those busy bees truly amazing?DID YOU KNOW? . Bees are hard workers. In winter, they can live up to nine months and in summer only up to two months. All work and no play does not make them dull. . A curious case of the bees is that when they do the work of a younger bee, their brain stops ageing. It starts working like a younger bees’ brain. Do you now wish you were a bee? . Bees recognize faces just like human beings do. Each part of the face is first taken separately, then put together to make up the face. Remember not to anger a bee!. Caffeine, a chemical used by plants to keep away harmful insects, helps bees remember the location of the flower. It welcomes the bees for a second visit. . Bumble bees are larger than honey bees and other types of bees. They live in hives and love to socialise. Many bumble bees do not have a sting. They may not produce much honey but are excellent pollinators.Be a bee! . A honey bee performs a dance that tells the rest of the hive where to find nectar. Now try to express some information through dance moves, and see if your friends are able to understand what you are communicating! . Try buzzing like a bee. . . flap your arms and see if you can hear a buzz.. A honeycomb, the house of the bees, is known to be a masterpiece of engineering. Why do you think? Try and draw perfect hexagons as in a honeycomb. Or make models using ordinary cartons. Maybe you’ll guess the answer then! . Try to carefully smell different flowers. You could then imagine how honey made from the nectar of different flowers can also taste different.	./Story text files/120.txt	3067	14	5.66984126984127	260	55	146	46.9375	41	23	29	9.90625	30	34	201	114	5	1.3596730245231607	325	42

She took another bite. And another. In no time, the plate was empty.""Good girl, "" said Appa. ""Now will you tell me why you’re so angry? "" ""NO! "" said Akku. ""Was it something I did? "" ""NO! "" ""Was it something Amma did? "" ""NO! "" ""Did something bad happen in school today? "" ""MAYBE! "" ""Oho. """"Would you like to draw it? "" asked Appa. ""Here’s a nice sheet of paper and some crayons. "" ""Okay, FINE! "" said Akku.Akku drew a brick… ""This is the STUPID BRICK that I tripped over this morning, "" said Akku. ""You’re right. That IS a VERY STUPID brick! "" said Appa.And Akku drew a boy… ""This is Bikku, a VERY BAD BOY! He laughed when I fell down! "" said Akku. ""You’re right, "" said Appa. ""He shouldn’t have laughed at you. ""And Akku drew an idli… ""This is my idli, "" said Akku. ""It fell out of my lunch box when I tripped over the STUPID BRICK! ""And Akku drew a crow… ""This is the VERY BAD CROW that flew off with my idli, "" said Akku. ""The crow must have been very hungry, "" said Appa.And Akku drew her teacher… ""This is my teacher, Amala Miss, "" said Akku. ""She helped me up when I fell down. And then she hugged me. "" ""That’s nice of her, "" said Appa. ""And then she pinched my cheeks. I DON’T LIKE IT when my cheeks are pinched. "" ""Oho! That must have HURT, no? "" ""A little bit. But I’m okay now.

Laugh loudly and jump around with your arms in the air! . Slowly – very, very slowly – breathe in, and breathe out! . Drink some water! Or buttermilk! . Eat a piece of fruit! Or a vada! .

"On her first day of vacation, Divya woke up later than usual. It was going to be a happy summer. Her cousin Ravi was going to visit her in Gajapur. He lived in the faraway city of Cuttack.'We'll play outdoors, ride cycles, swim in the pond, pluck mangoes. . . we're going to have so much fun, ' she thought.But Ravi was going to travel on his own for the first time. She had given him directions over the phone. ""Walk straight from the bus stand, straight, straight, and then you'll see the pond, keep walking straight, then take a right. . . no, no, take a left and keep walking for about. . . hmm. . . three minutes. . . when you reach the postoffice, take a left there. . . ""Divya was sure Ravi was confused. She was worried. How would he find her place?Then she had an idea. 'I'll make a map for Ravi, ' she thought. 'That will help him find his way. 'She took out a pencil and a large sheet of paper from the cupboard. First, she drew her house, and herself next to it. Then she went outside. One by one, she started drawing other buildings and streets.At the market, Binoy uncle and Sarita aunty sat in their shop. ""What are you doing, Divya? "" asked Binoy uncle. ""I'm drawing a map of our town, "" said Divya. ""Ooh, how exciting, "" cried Sarita aunty. ""Are we in it? ""She and Binoy uncle came out to look at the map. ""You are right here, "" said Divya. She drew a bright yellow square with Binoy uncle and Sarita aunty beside it.Then Divya crossed the road and reached the big banyan tree next to the ISPAT hospital.Ramesh, who always sat there, called out, ""Hello Divya. What are you up to? "" ""I'm making a map. "" ""Really? You should add me. Under the banyan tree. "" Divya laughed, but he was right  Ramesh under the banyan tree was a common sight. So she drew them too.Divya continued on her way. By the post office, she saw Mohan uncle, the postman, getting off his bike. ""Hello Divya, what are you doing? "" he asked. ""She is making a map! And we're all in it! "" said Ramesh who had followed Divya.""Oh? "" said Mohan uncle. ""Don't forget the post office. "" Divya drew a red rectangle for the post office.Then Divya went southwards. After five minutes, she reached a pond where some women were washing clothes. By now, everyone had heard that Divya was drawing a map. ""Put us in too, "" called Shabnam aunty.Divya drew a large blue pond, with the women by it. Some children had gathered at Divya's side. ""Come with me, "" she said, leading them home. ""I'll show you something. ""Divya led them to the terrace. They looked down at the town. The sun was setting and they could see its reflection in the pond. They looked at the map. Then they looked at the town again.""Gajapur is so big, but we can show its landmarks in a small map like said Divya. She was rather happy with her work. this, "" ""But how will Ravi know the exact directions from your map? "" asked her friend Kala. Divya looked at the map. ""Ooh! "" she exclaimed. ""I'll draw a trail. """"What's a trail? "" Charu wanted to know. ""A trail shows you which route to follow. She coloured the route yellow and added red arrows. It was a cheerfullooking map.Divya folded it, put it in an envelope, stuck some stamps on it and posted it to Ravi in Cuttack.One week later, the doorbell rang. When Divya opened the door, she found Ravi standing outside, holding her map. ""Here I am! "" he grinned. Divya's map had worked.Divya can be a cartographer A person who makes maps is called a cartographer. Cartography is a study that combines science, geography, art, and mathematics.Maps help you  See where a town or a city is located  Understand how far places are from each other, maybe even how to reach them  Tell what is special about a place  Give us information about mountains, rivers, deserts, and also the population and natural resources of a place; these are usually shown using symbols and coloursScale When you draw a map, how do you show that a mountain is very tall, or that a house is half the height of a coconut tree? You use a scale. This is the relationship between the size of something on the map and its actual size. A map scale might say that one centimetre corresponds to one kilometre. That means, if you draw a pond that is  cm across, you are saying it is really  km across.The scale can also tell you how far one place is from another. If the distance between two points is  centimetres and the scale is  centimetre =  kilometre, then the actual distance between the two places is  km."	./Story text files/327.txt	4461	16	5.413934426229508	404	84	453	41.094339622641506	75	31	89	8.971698113207546	62	44	298	190	4	1.288888888888889	533	52
Maaloo went to his Nani’s place with his dog, Kaaloo. Nani’s house was in the hills.When he got there, Nani said, “Maaloo, there are strange sounds coming from the garden these days. Keep the doors of the house shut.”At once, Maaloo took out his detective’s bag. He pulled out his binoculars and went into the garden. He looked at each tree, plant and creeper very carefully.Suddenly, he spotted a big beehive on a tree in the corner of the garden.Maaloo ran to Nani. “Nani, there are so many bees buzzing around the mulberry tree.” “Right Maaloo. But even a thousand bees cannot make the heavy sounds I have heard,” said Nani. “This could only be a thief. . . or a ghost!”Maaloo picked up a long stick and made his way to the garden again. Kaaloo started going round and round on the grass with his nose to the ground… ghoon ghoon ghoon.“Kaaloo, stop all this drama. Don’t spoil the grass,” Maaloo called out. But Kaaloo wagged his tail very hard and kept going in circles there.Maaloo ran to Kaaloo. He looked at the grass and found big paw prints. These were the tracks of a bear! “Very good Kaaloo, you have found the Bhaaloo!”Kaaloo and Maaloo ran to Nani.“No thief, no bandit, nor a ghost is it,” said Maaloo.“A bear comes to visit. Honey and mulberry are his favourite!”	./Story text files/9.txt	1277	19	5.865671641791045	117	17	97	41.6	19	11	19	8.633333333333333	17	13	81	53	4	1.3459119496855345	152	7

"THUMP, THUMP, THUMP! The noise wakes up Unni and he looks outside the window. Some men are digging and hammering near his home. There are thick wires and wooden poles all around them. Unni wonders if they are building a new house in the forest.Unni finds Amma pressing his school uniform with a clothes iron full of hot coal. “Amma, who are these men working outside our home?” asks Unni. “You’ll find out soon. Now go and eat your idlis before they become cold,” replies Amma, with a mysterious smile.After breakfast, Unni pulls on his warm uniform. “Bye, Amma!” Unni hurries through the forest towards the coffee estate. His best friend Ammu lives here. There she is, waving at him! “Let’s race!” says Ammu. And off they go!The two friends zip through the coffee plants. They circle around the big mango tree. They hop across the stream. And finally, they reach the road that leads to school.Unni hears Ammu humming a tune as they walk to class. It’s from her favourite cartoon show on TV. “The boy in the cartoon fights villains using his magic glasses!” she explains. Unni wonders when he will have a TV at home.TRINGGGGG! The school bell rings. Unni and Ammu hurry to catch the bench under the fan. What a wonderful breeze! Unni imagines sleeping under a fan at home. It would be great in the summer!At break time, Unni and his friends run out to play. It’s a very hot day and they soon get thirsty. They go to Kuttan Chettan’s shop to buy lime juice. BRRR! The glass feels cold in Unni’s sticky hands! “If we had a fridge at home, Amma’s lime juice would taste this good,” Unni mumbles to himself.Unni’s head is bursting with questions. He decides to find Janaki Miss. “Kuttan Chettan’s shop has a fridge but we don’t have one at home. There’s a fan at school but we don’t have one in our room. Ammu has a TV at home but I don’t. Why is that, Miss?” asks Unni.“Where do you stay?” Janaki Miss asks. “In the forest, Miss. Beyond the coffee estate.” “Oho! Lights, fans, fridges and TVs need electricity to work. It sounds like your home doesn’t have an electricity connection.” “But why?” asks Unni. Janaki Miss replies, “Electricity comes through wires from the village power station. Since you live deep in the forest, it is difficult for the wires to reach your home.” Unni is disappointed.After school, the two friends race back to Ammu’s home in the coffee estate. The sun is setting. Ammu turns on the tubelight. “I’m going to go study now,” she says. ""It's getting dark. Let me get home quickly. I need to light the kerosene lamp, "" says Unni, sighing.Outside their house, Unni sees his father talking to some men. It’s the men who made all the noise in the morning. “What is happening, Acha?” Unni asks.Everyone turns and smiles at him. Amma points to a switch on the wall. Unni presses the switch and. . . TA DA! THE ROOM LIGHTS UP! Everyone claps. This can only mean one thing. . . “I can’t believe it!” says Unni. “Our house finally has electricity!”Unni can now study under the tubelight, sleep under the fan, drink chilled lime juice, and finally watch the adventures of the superhero with magic glasses!Did You Know?

Once there were some children. They lived on at the edge of a city. They lived near a huge garbage dump. The garbage dump was very big. It stretched as far as you could see.The children did not go to school. They ran around in the dump all day. Some collected plastic bottles. Some others sorted out pieces of cloth. All of them knew many things about the garbage.One day, Didi came to the dump. She had a red dupatta. Didi looked at the children running around. Then she looked for a place to sit. She opened her bag and took out something.The children were curious. They moved a bit closer. Didi had lots of colourful books. The books had stories inside them. The children moved closer and closer.Didi started coming every day. The children stopped roaming in the dump when she came. They sat with her and listened to the stories. Soon they could read some letters and some words. Before long they were reading stories too.The children decided to make Didi’s place look good. Someone brought a chair from the dump. Someone else found a piece of carpet. Some brought some curtains. Soon Didi’s place looked good.One day Didi did not come. The next day too Didi did not come. The children waited and waited. They read the books by themselves. And they read the books to each other.One day the children found Didi's address in a book. They set off to look for her. They carried a bag of books. The children could read the bus name. They looked for her road number. They could do all this because Didi had taught them.The children looked for her house. They looked up and down each lane. But they could not find it. Just as they were coming back, someone saw a red dupatta. It was hanging on a hook near the window.There was Didi lying in bed. She looked very sick. Her eyes were sad and she did not smile. The doctor had given her medicines. But somehow she was not getting better.The children ran to Didi. They hugged her and they kissed her. They brought her books to her. Didi sat up and the children read to her. Her eyes began to shine and her smile came back.Now Didi comes every day again. And the children do too. You can see them every evening. You can hear them laughing. You can hear them reading. You can tell they are having so much fun. The children, their Didi and the books.	./Story text files/293.txt	2289	13	5.631111111111111	186	39	57	34.78125	59	5	12	7.59375	44	20	164	61	4	1.2565055762081785	255	14
Munia knew that the giant, onefeathered elephant bird had not swallowed the horse. Yes, he was big enough to swallow a horse, but that didn't mean he had! The village of Adhania had only one horsecart pulled by the two horses Vayu and Drut. And Vayu had gone missing near the lake in the jungle where the bird lived. The villagers had known about the elephant bird for generations.He was the last of his race, which was considered extinct for hundreds of years. The world did not know that the living relic of that race, who had lost all his feathers but one, still roamed the jungles of Adhania. The bird and the villagers kept a safe distance from each other. But not Munia. Although she walked with a limp, she was brave of heart. She often slipped into the jungle to watch the elephant bird.The elephant bird came near the lake in the daytime to bask in the sun or play in the lake alone splashing water. Sometimes he sat halfsubmerged in water. At other times there was no trace of him. Perhaps he just rested in some corner of the dense jungle. He stood as tall as a tree. He had a long strong neck, huge legs with claws and a heavy spearlike head. His long talons and nails looked scary.But Munia soon realised he was a shy herbivorous bird. He just munched on leaves by the lakeside. Munia felt she had something in common with him. The elephant bird could not fly and Munia could not run! Other village children mocked her limp and did not include her in their games. That was why she liked staying alone.Every morning Munia helped fetch three pitchers of water from the village well, and collected wood so that Amma could light the stove. And then she would be out for a long time. Amma believed she went out to play with the kids. Little did she know that Munia went into the jungle to the lake where the elephant bird lived.One day, gathering courage, Munia stepped in the open near the lake. Without turning his head the elephant bird rolled his eyes towards Munia and then closed them, uninterested by her advance. Getting no more attention than the flies buzzing over his head, Munia stomped her feet. Suddenly the elephant bird lifted one of his claws. Munia cried and fell headlong into the shallow waters of the lake. She came out drenched to see him shaking all over. He was laughing!“That’s funny, huh?” she asked angrily and turned to leave. Before Munia had walked away from the clearing, something hit her feet. It was a fruit that the elephant bird had thrown at her. The elephant bird wanted to play! Hesitantly, Munia threw it at him. He trotted sideways and caught the fruit in his beak. Thus, Munia’s friendship with the elephant bird had begun. And just when she had finally found a friend, Vayu had gone missing! And everyone’s suspicion had turned towards the elephant bird.After searching for Vayu high and low, the villagers gathered under the old banyan tree. Everyone agreed that there could be no thief in Adhania. They all trusted one another. The milkman swore that he had seen Vayu gallop away towards the lake. “There is no sign of Vayu anywhere. It must be something in the jungle that got him,” a villager addressed the headman. “Who else can it be but the giant one feathered elephant bird? He must be destroyed!” said the milkman. “For years he has been lying silent, hatching his evil plans!”The crowd agreed. Munia watched the proceedings quietly. She wanted to speak, but was scared of being punished for speaking up. Even if she spoke, who would believe her? “Yes, all these years of aimless living has made the giant dangerous,” said Munia’s father. “Today it is a horse, tomorrow it may be our children…” The headman spoke over the villagers’ angry shouts, “Brothers, even though we are facing a giant, we have the strength of numbers. So let us go out and finish him!”A cheer of approval went up. “The elephant bird did not eat the horse,” Munia said softly but firmly, limping forward. “I was with him when Vayu went missing!” A heavy silence fell on the gathering. “What does this mean?” roared the headman. “That the elephant bird is my friend, and he has not done this!” “This girl has lost her mind!” shouted someone from the back. The other children laughed. “He only eats leaves! How can he eat Vayu?” Munia shouted, not moving from her place.“You can’t even plait your hair and you are giving us advice?” Munia’s father fumed and came towards her. “Go play with your friends!” “This elephant bird is the only friend I have,” said Munia. Her father glared at her. But she didn’t cry and stood there facing the villagers. “Forget about the girl, we will get the elephant bird in the morning,” said the headman and the gathering dispersed.Munia had only one night to prove the elephant bird’s innocence. “Think, Munia, think!” she whispered to herself. “The milkman saw Vayu gallop away on the road that goes to the lake. But the road takes a turn before it reaches the lake and goes towards Chandesara. What if Vayu had gone that way?” Munia’s parents were angry with her and sent her to bed without speaking a word. Once they were asleep, she got out of bed, took the hanging lamp and stepped out of the house.She crossed Adhania, and came to the jungle path leading to Chandesara, the neighbouring village. Whoooo. . . rang the call of an owl in the jungle air. A jackal howled from a distance. The shadows of trees moved like long dark fingers. She hesitated for a moment but then thought of the elephant bird sleeping peacefully in the jungle. If she didn't do something to solve the mystery, the elephant bird may not be alive to see the next night. She took a deep breath and limped alone on the jungle path in the dead of the night.The next morning the villagers gathered near the lake with sticks, sharp stones and long kitchen knives. The elephant bird was resting when the crowd approached him. The sun shone on his featherless back. He got up slowly and stared at the crowd. Looking at his size, the villagers stopped at some distance. After a moment’s hesitation the headman cried, “Be ready!” The mob roared, firming the grip on the weapons, ready to run down the giant onefeathered elephant bird.“Stop!” Munia’s thin voice cut through the din. She limped between the mob and the giant. “Munia! Come back at once!” her father ordered. “Grab her!” cried someone else. Munia’s father and another villager rushed towards her. The elephant bird advanced a couple of steps and they stopped. “Okay… if this is how you want it, we’ll tackle both of you together!” yelled a man, holding a spear.“What’s going on?” someone shouted from behind the crowd. A slightly hunched man with a long beard came in holding a horse’s reins. The headman asked with a surprised look, “Saarthi, what are you doing here? And why is Vayu with you?”“Oh, as you know, I had sold Vayu to you some years back. Yesterday I was passing by your village early in the morning in my buggy pulled by Jhabru and Ghabru – Vayu’s brothers. I don’t know how Vayu got loose and followed us back to Chandesara! I couldn’t recognize him and didn’t know what to do with him until this morning when I saw this little girl going from hut to hut, asking about a lost horse. But what is going on?” he asked again.The villagers did not answer Saarthi. They hung their heads in shame. Munia’s father went to her, lifted her in his arms and took her back to the village. Since that day, no child laughed at Munia’s limp. They all wanted to be friends with her. And they all wanted to be friends with the elephant bird. Munia’s tale reached many villages and the villagers in faraway hamlets whispered to each other, “Munia knew that the giant onefeathered elephant bird had not swallowed the horse!”This story is inspired by the real Elephant Bird (scientific name: Aepyornis maximus), the biggest bird that walked our planet. It inhabited the island of Madagascar. With more and more settlements on the island, and more forests ruined, the species became extinct around  CE.	./Story text files/4.txt	7992	16	5.964956195244055	623	176	186	55.687943262411345	67	74	34	11.106382978723405	54	87	485	314	5	1.4779735682819384	791	117

What a sweet smell! Where is it coming from?Not from here! This is the lovely smell of flowers.Not from here! This is the bad smell of cow dung.Eek! This is the yuckymucky smell of my dirty socks.Mmmm. . . This is the yummy smell of hot luchiaalu!Aha! That sweet smell is from here! From this new sweet stall. The sweet smell is coming from these fresh gulab jamoons!Dear friends, did you know that the inside of our noses are lined with millions of cells? These cells help us smell things. They help us tell if they are good smells or bad smells. Smell helps us guess the taste of things. The smell of something also tells us how far we are from it.The sense of smell is much stronger in animals than it is in humans. Haven’t you noticed that mosquitoes smell us out, no matter where we are?And who tells the ants about the crumbs that we drop on the floor while eating? Simple. It’s their sense of smell! Everyone knows that dogs have very sharp noses. That’s how they help us find robbers and bombs.So do you know why we take a deep breath when we are passing by a beautiful garden? And why we cover our noses when we are near a garbage heap?Because something is telling us to do so. And that something is our fantastic sense of smell!	./Story text files/449.txt	1238	14	5.590163934426229	103	19	88	36.54545454545455	23	10	18	8.030303030303031	17	16	88	34	4	1.1914893617021276	129	12

"One day, grandfather gave my brother and me some money. ""Go and buy books, "" he said. We were both very happy. We both love to read.Should we go now? Should we go later? Should we go today? Should we go tomorrow? We decided to go right now.Should we go to the big market? Should we go to the small shop? Should we go with somebody? Should we go alone? We decided to go to the small shop, just the two of us.We like the small bookshop. It is small but it has many books. The man in the shop likes us. He always helps us.Should I buy a book with a lot of pictures? Should I buy a book with many stories? Should I buy a thin book? I could not decide.We do not know which book to buy. The man in the shop smiled at us. “Relax, come with me,” he said. “These books are about animals. Those are about machines. Those over there are about wars. Take what you want.”I picked up some books. My brother picked up some books. I sat on the floor. He sat on the chair. And we read and we read and we read.It was very quiet. There was no sound. One hour passed. Two hours passed. Finally, we knew which books to buy.The man in the bookshop smiled at us. I got a fat book with many stories. My brother got a big book with many pictures. We ran home to our grandfather. We climbed on his bed.

Chuskit woke up early that morning. It was a very special day and she was too excited to sleep. She eagerly looked out of the room through the window next to her bed. It was spring time in Ladakh and the apricot trees were in full bloom. Two magpies had already begun their day and were busy looking for insects to eat. Her Amaley was awake too. She could hear her in the kitchen making gurgur tea.Chuskit had been awake for the last hour. This was a day she was going to remember for a long time. Can you guess why? No, it was not Losar, the New Year festival. That was many months away. Nor was it any special day in her village, like the Gonpa festival, or a wedding day. Today was going to be Chuskit's first day at school. At nine years, she had waited a long, long time for this.The school was not very far away from her home. To get there, you had to walk up to the main road. Just before the prayer wheel, you took the path to the left of the road that ran along a narrow stream. Near the poplar trees you crossed the stream by jumping over the big rocks. Once you got to the other side, a short walk up a slope took you to the school. All the children of Skitpo Yul, Chuskit's village, walked to school everyday and with ease. But not little Chuskit. She had a disability and could not walk.Chuskit was born with legs that did not work like everyone else’s. Her father had taken her to the village amchi and then to the doctors in Leh. But no amount of medicine had helped her walk. At first, Chuskit did not realise that she was in any way different from Stobdan, her younger brother, or her cousins. But soon there were many things she could not do as easily as them. “That does not matter,” her Abaley would tell her whenever she felt sad. “You can stitch better than any of them. And you draw very well.” Abaley often brought her some colour pencils from Leh.Chuskit would sit at the kitchen window everyday and draw what she saw while her Amaley cooked. She could see her family's animals being taken to graze every morning. She could see the blue waters of the stream that flowed near by. And she would be the first one to announce the arrival of a visitor to their house!Chuskit used a chair fitted with wheels to move around. Elders called it a wheelchair. You could move it in any direction forward, left, right and even backward  by moving the wheels with your hands. You only needed to have really strong arms to push the weight of your body and the chair. When Abaley first brought the wheelchair home, everyone in her family was very excited.“Now I won’t have to carry Chuskit everywhere. I can wheel her around,” said Amaley, with tears of happiness in her eyes. “And I will be able to go wherever I want!” cried Chuskit excitedly. “Please, please, could I ride on your wheelchair once in a way?” begged Stobdan. He wanted to wheel it around too. It looked like fun. Billa, the big black cat, jumped on to the wheel chair and stretched across the seat. “Yes this is far more comfortable than the sack cloth I sleep on,” she purred.Slowly, Chuskit learnt to use her wheelchair. She would ask her mother to seat her in the wheelchair outside her home every evening. From here she would watch children returning from school, chattering and laughing merrily in groups. In a while, the evening bus would return from Leh, bringing back people from work and the market place. How much more exciting the world was from here than from the kitchen window!One evening when Chuskit was sitting outside the house with her grandfather, a young boy came up to her. He carried a letter which he handed over to her grandfather. “Julley! The bus driver asked me to give this to you,” he said. “My name is Abdul,” he said turning to Chuskit. “I study Class  at the Government School. I have often wondered why you don’t come to school.” “Julley, Abdul,” said Chuskit. “I have never been to school. The path to the school is too uneven and pebbly and my wheelchair will get stuck. Besides, I cannot cross the little stream in front of the school. It would be very difficult for my parents to carry me to school and back everyday.” “But would you like to come to school?” asked Abdul.“Of course!” replied Chuskit. “I hear my younger brother talk of all that he does at school. I want to study like all of you, make friends, play games, wear a uniform and even write exams. Sometimes my brother teaches me songs that he has learnt at school and I love it. You may not believe this, but I sometimes dream of carrying a school bag, even eating packed lunch. . .” “Enough! Enough!” interrupted her grandfather. “Stop dreaming, Chuskit. You know you cannot go to school. I have told you this many times. Learn as much as you can at home.”“Memeley, please,” pleaded Chuskit softly with tears in her eyes as her grandfather walked away angrily. “Memeley does not understand how I feel,” said Chuskit. “I remember the day my brother recited his tables with such pride, even the time he learned to read! My parents were very happy as they have never been to school. I too want to learn to read and do math. Do you understand?” “I do,” said Abdul. “Chuskit, I will see you again. I must go now. My mother will be waiting for me. Julley!”The next day, Abdul went straight to the Headmaster’s room after assembly. “Julley, Azhangley!” he said. “I want to talk to you about a girl from our village who does not go to school. Her name is Chuskit. She is Stobdan’s sister.” “Oh yes,” replied the Headmaster. “I know her. She is disabled, isn’t she?”“Yes, Azhangley. She uses a wheelchair to move around but cannot reach school, as the path from her home is too rough and uneven. I was wondering if we could do anything to help her, Azhangley. We could all get together and level the path and also build a small bridge across the stream.” “That’s very thoughtful of you, Abdul,” said the Headmaster as he patted him on the back. “What made you think of Chuskit and her problems?” “Azhangley, last week we read about the fundamental rights of citizens in our civics class. All children have a right to education. That includes Chuskit as well, does it not?” “Yes, you are right, Abdul. Let me discuss this with the other teachers,” replied the Headmaster.The next day the Headmaster called all the teachers to a meeting. He shared Abdul’s ideas with the group and asked the teachers what they felt. “Impossible!” said one of them. “How can we have a disabled child in our school? How will she be able to write, play and go to the toilet like the other children do?”“That's exactly what we have to work out,” said the Headmaster. “I hear that in the village of Mentok Yul, the Village Education Committee has helped build a special toilet for one of their disabled children. We could ask them what they have done. But first we will have to get Chuskit to school. Then we could think of ways of helping her do things in school.”Two weeks later there was great excitement at the Government School. All the children had gathered outside in the playground. They had come to school without their school bags: there were going to be no classes today!The teachers divided the children into groups. One group worked in front of Chuskit's house and another on the path along the stream. A third group with some of the older children worked hard to help some of their teachers build a strong wooden bridge across the stream.The children laughed and sang as they removed stones and rocks, levelled paths and carried wooden planks to the stream. The Headmaster went from one group to another, making sure that all went according to plan.Chuskit’s parents provided everyone with hot tea and biscuits. Chuskit’s grandfather sat under a willow tree by the stream watching the busy school children. “I never dreamt I’d see a day like this!” he thought to himself as he wiped a tear that rolled down his cheek. At the end of the day it was a tired but happy group of children that returned to their homes. The path from Chuskit’s home to the school was now ready!Chuskit was going to school for the first time in her life. And that's why she was so excited!Words used in the story that may be new to you: Abaley: Father Amaley: Mother Memeley: Grandfather Amchi: A local doctor who has been trained in Tibetan medicine. Azhangley: Term used with respect for an elderly man. Gonpa: Buddhist monastery Gurgur tea: Butter tea that is made in a long cylindrical wooden vessel. The tea is churned with butter, salt and milk in this vessel. A low gurgur noise is produced during churning.

If you travel around India from NORTH to SOUTH and from EAST to WEST, you will see people making things everywhere  in the fields, beside the road, in open doorways, and on verandahs. They make things to eat, to wear, to sell and to help build India and its people. And it’s all there for everyone to see. . . * Map of India on next page not to scaleHere are two Himachali women I met when I was walking in the Himalayan Mountains in Himachal Pradesh in the NORTH. Do you know what these women are doing? I have painted them with sheep because they are using SHEEP’S WOOL for what they are making. One woman SPINS the wool to make it into an even thread. The other is KNITTING a multi coloured, woolly jumper. Wool can be dyed all the colours of the rainbow. But I rather like the woman who is wearing a natural coloured outfitit’s the same colour as the brown sheep.This is a sight you see all over India : Women collecting water from a well to drink and cook with. These women are from Haryana in the NORTH. Well water is usually the cleanest and safest water to drink as it comes straight from deep under the ground, far from all the pollution that can seep into surface water. These women are wearing the typical North Indian dress the Salwar Kameez. Look at how well they balance two pots of water on their heads. Could you do that?I saw this man at work sitting outside his workshop in Karnataka in the SOUTH. He is a sculptor and he is using a hammer and a chisel to make an image of a god out of stone. Can you guess which one? * I have painted all the tools he uses for his work. I think they make interesting shapes all lined up together. Surrounding him are other sculptures he has made  of animals and people. Do you recognize any of them? *GaneshOn the edge of a forest in KARNATAKA I came across these women collecting FIREWOOD. They are wandering gypsies from a tribe called the BANJARA tribe. Look at the heavy jewellery they wear. But even HEAVIER must be these huge bundles of sticks they are carrying. Can you see how they have wound up pieces of cloth into a tight circle and placed it on their heads to help them balance the load? This also protects them from any thorns or spikes the sticks may have. Can you guess what fruit is growing on the trees?These women are also from KARNATAKA and they are helping MAKE one of the most important things to eat in India  RICE. Rice grows in flooded fields called PADDY FIELDS . Here the women are ankledeep in the paddies replanting the RICE SAPLINGSat regular intervals so that the rice will grow strong and healthy. Can you see how the women have tied up their sarees so that their clothes don’t get wet in the water? I think their backs must ache by the end of the day, don’t you?I saw these men mending a railway track in Goa on the SOUTHWEST coast of India. Can you see all the different tools they use? I like the fact that the workers’ uniforms use the colours of the Indian flag: orange, white and green. Can you see the man who is in charge of all the workers? I made the railway into the shape of a clock as trains have to be on time.I visited a village in Odisha in the EAST entirely made up of craftspeople. Everybody was sitting outside their houses and workshops MAKING things. This lady is a papiermache painter. She has painted, amongst other things, some brightly coloured images of JAGANNATH. Do you know who he is? He is Krishna by another name. Look at all the different patterns and the different colours the painter uses. She hopes to sell her wares to tourists and pilgrims. I like her elephant masks best, do you?Beside a dusty village road in Bengal in the EAST, I came upon this man  called a ‘thathera’*  beating tin strips into a bucket shape. First he decorated the tin by puncturing holes in its surface with a pin to make interesting patterns. Then he rolled the metal into a cylinder (as he is doing here) and making a great racket, he bashed the two ends together with small pins. Finally he attached the base of the bucket in the same way. They look very pretty, don’t you think? *This is the word in HindiThese people are making BRICKS. I like the way the name stamped on the brick is GOLD, as if they were nuggets of gold instead of bricks made out of baked earth. Here the women are taking some specially prepared BRICK CLAY and are shaping it in the rectangular wooden moulds. They slice off any excess clay with a strip of metal. Bricks are baked in a special oven called a KILN and the entire process of making a brick takes  DAYS. These ovens have tall, thin, towerlike chimneys. You can see these CHIMNEYS all over India, dotting the countryside. I saw these brickmakers in BENGAL.Travelling through BENGAL, I passed a lot of small, round ponds called Pukurs. There I saw these FISHERWOMEN carrying their round NETS with the day’s catch in the little BASKETS which they strap to their heads. I watched them catch fish. A group of women stood up to their waists in WATER, forming a row in the pond. They each splashed the water vigorously holding the bamboo rim of their nets. Then, altogether, they would dip their nets lower into the water, and, altogether, scoop up any fish. I have painted the fish their actual size. People like to eat them fried and crispy. Would you?I went to a wedding in RAJASTHAN in the WEST and I watched a huge wedding feast being prepared. These women were MAKING CHAPATIS. They sat in a circle, each person helping with one stage of the chapati making. So the first lady sieved the flour through a metal sheet with lots of holes in it. Another, adding water, kneaded it into dough with her fist. The next separated the dough into little balls, ready for the final rolling out into a chapati shape. A large plate of ready rolled chapatis was then whisked off into the kitchen to be cooked for the wedding feast.These women are ROAD BUILDERS. I saw them flattening out some rocky ground in RAJASTHAN. They used their picks and shovels to help clear a pathway through the desert. Later, a proper road for cars and trucks will be laid down. These women come from the RABARI tribe in Rajasthan. I was particularly struck by the colourful clothes they wore and the strength these women had to do this very hard work. Which lady is wearing the most bangles? And can you spot a tiffin box?	./Story text files/115.txt	6316	17	5.849586776859504	501	104	182	69.97752808988764	28	61	34	14.202247191011235	19	70	347	258	5	1.486049926578561	595	86

Sister, sister I wonder. . . What do you wonder, little brother, What do you wonder? I wonder, I wonder, Where thunder comes from. Where do you think, little brother, Where do you think? I think, I think Tell me, little brother, What do you think?I think That there is a great big Kumbhakarna Sleeping in the sky And when the silver ropes of rain Lash him, and chase his sleep away, He wakes up. Sparks fly out of his eyes like lightning He stamps his big ugly feet Takes a long deep breath And ROARS with rage.(Let me tell you If I had thrown a tantrum like that Mother would have spanked me. Hard. ) I think that’s Where the thunder comes from From the fury of a Kumbhakarna in the sky Who likes to stay asleep, and dry. I’m clever, aren’t I, sister?Oh yes you are, little brother, oh yes you are. And maybe you’re right, too… But in the books that I have read That is not what they said. Then what did they say, sister, What did they say? What do you think, little brother, What do you think? I think, I think… Tell me, little brother, What do you think?I think There is a gang of crazy bikers Up there in the sky In their black leather jackets And steelstudded boots And dark glasses that hide their eyes Just like in the movies. And what they like to do best Is to race each other in the pouring rain.I think When they mount their bikes and KICK them to life Steel strikes steel There’s your lightning! Then, when they do what bikers do Rev up their engines, and rrrev them, and rrrev them There’s your thunder!I think that’s where the thunder comes from Not from a demon, not from a plane, But from a fleet of bikes that race in the rain. I’m clever, aren’t I, sister?I know you are, little brother, I know you are And maybe you’re right, too… But in all the books that I have read That is not what they said. Then what did they say, sister, What did they say? What do you think, little brother, What do you think? I think, I think… Tell me, little brother, What do you think?I think That when it rains The children Of the old woman in the sky Are absolutely NOT allowed To play outside (for they may catch a cold! ). Cooped up indoors They all get a little restless, and VERY cranky.I think the old woman opens her trunk Pulls out a game of chaupad And a pair of giant dice. The children clap their hands in excitement Roll the giant dice And forget they were ever bored. I think that’s where the thunder comes from From the dance of a pair of dice As they make their way across the skies. I’m clever, aren’t I, sister?Of course you are, little brother, And maybe you’re right, too… But in all the books that I have read That is not what they said. Then what did they say, sister, What did they say? Come here, little brother, I’ll tell you what they said. They said, they said… Tell me sister, what did they say?They said That thunder always comes after lightning. But you know that, don't you? And that It is the lightning That makes the thunder.The lightning is like ELECTRICITY The same magic ELECTRICITY That runs the pump And floods the house with light And fills the TV with Sachin and Saurav At the flip of a switch. But I asked about thunder, sister, I asked about thunder. Have patience, little brother, Have patience now.They said that lightning is very hot Just like electricity. And when it slices through the air And stabs the earth It makes the air through which it comes Very Very Very hot. They said The hot air EXPANDS And explodes BOOOOOOM! Like a monster Diwali bomb.And some little children Bury their faces In their mothers’ sarees. But brave little boys like you Hear the air go BOOOOOOM! Turn around quickly. Can it be true, sister, can it be true? I can’t say, little brother, I can’t say. But in all the books that I have read That is what they said.FIND OUT MORE! Where does thunder come from? Everything around us is made up of tiny particles called atoms. Each atom has a nucleus at the centre, which is filled with particles called neutrons and positively charged particles called protons. Even tinier particles (negatively charged) called electrons go around the nucleus like the planets go around the sun. In a thundercloud, air carries bits of ice and water droplets upwards. When they rub against each other, the atoms in them become ions (that is, they become charged positively or negatively). The positive ions are lighter and move upwards, while the heavier negative ions move downwards to the bottom of the cloud.The negative ions at the bottom of the cloud attract the positive ions on the earth. When they start flowing towards each other, electricity is created, which becomes a huge, powerful flash of lightning. The lightning makes the air around it very, very hot almost as hot as the sun! This hot air expands very quickly, causing a big explosion. It then begins to contract equally quickly once the lightning flash has passed. This explosion of air is what causes the sound waves that we call thunder.Try this experiment! To understand how particles with opposite charges attract each other, let’s make a magic ‘magnetic balloon’! You need: A balloon A piece of wool or silk A wall What to do: . Blow up the balloon. . Rub it briskly with the piece of wool or silk. . Hold it against the wall and watch it ‘stick’ there like a magnet to iron! Why does this happen? When you rub the balloon with the wool or silk, electrons get transferred between the two. The atoms in the balloon take in more electrons, so the balloon becomes negatively charged. When you hold it against the wall, the negative ions in the balloon get attracted to the positive ions in the wall, causing the balloon to stick to the wall!	./Story text files/359.txt	5660	13	5.696363636363636	448	102	175	68.03658536585365	25	57	34	13.707317073170731	21	61	330	220	5	1.4114754098360656	563	47

Knock, knock! Amma opened the door. “Raghu Mama!” Amish and Soni cried, giving him a big hug.Raghu Mama was their mother’s only brother. He always told the best stories and brought them the most interesting presents. But there was one problem with Raghu Mama.Raghu Mama was so lazy that he could sit in his chair for hours and hours and hours, reading or watching TV. Or just sleeping. He would not do any work around the house or even go to the market to buy groceries. Amma was fed up of his laziness.“So, Raghu,” said Amma. “Planning to spend the holiday in your favourite chair as usual?” “Oh no!” said Raghu Mama. “This time I’m going to explore underwater caves, climb tall mountains, and chase tigers in the jungle.” “Where, where?” exclaimed Amish and Soni. “We want to come too!” “Hah!” said Amma. “What a joke!” Raghu Mama smiled mysteriously.The next day when Raghu Mama was in his room, Amish and Soni overheard him talking to someone. “Wow!” he was saying. Then, “That’s AMAZING!” A little later, “OH NO!” The children burst into his room. “What happened, Raghu Mama?”Raghu Mama was in his favourite chair, wearing a pair of big black goggles. There was no one else around! Soni and Amish exchanged a curious look. “Is everything okay, Mama?” Amish asked, staring at the dark goggles that hid almost all of Mama’s face. Raghu laughed and took off the goggles. “Here, try this,” he said to Soni. “What is it?” asked Soni. The goggles were so heavy that she had to hold them with both hands.Raghu Mama carefully put the goggles on Soni’s face. The goggles were dark and she couldn’t see anything at first. Then he pressed a button. Suddenly Soni was under the ocean! There were colourful fish all around. She turned her face to the left and saw a big turtle swimming beside her. It was so close that she thought she could reach out and touch it. Then she turned her face to the other side . . . “Eek!” she cried as a big shark swam very close to her.“Let me see, let me see!” said Amish, trying to take the goggles off from a stunned Soni. “It will be your turn next, Amish,” said Raghu Mama. “I have just the adventure for you.” Amish put on the goggles and Mama pressed another button. “Ooh, I can see herds of chital! And langurs!” Amish was in a thick forest full of trees. He could hear different bird sounds. When he looked up, he could see a flock of geese flying in a Vshaped formation in the sky.“It feels so real,” said Soni. “When I wore the goggles it was as if I were swimming underwater!” “Yes,” said Raghu Mama. “I guess that is why it is called ‘Virtual Reality’.” Soni was confused. “But doesn’t ‘virtual’ mean ‘not real’?” she asked. “So how can you have ‘reality’ that is not real?” “That is a really smart question,” said Raghu Mama. “We call it Virtual Reality, or VR, because it makes you feel that what you are watching is real. So it is almost real.” “Help!” cried Amish. “A tiger is about to eat me up!” Raghu Mama laughed. “Don’t worry, you are quite safe!” he told Amish. “It is like watching a movie, but better,” said Soni, excited. “Exactly,” said Mama. “When we watch a movie in a cinema theatre, the screen is only in front of us. When we wear the VR goggles, it feels like the movie is all around us.”“So, do you want to spend your summer vacation exploring Virtual Reality like me?” asked Raghu Mama. Amish took off the goggles and thought for a bit. “I think I prefer the REAL reality,” he said. “But why?” asked Raghu Mama, surprised. “I saw a juicy mango in the jungle,” said Amish. “And now I want to eat one. I can’t do that in Virtual Reality.” “I want one too!” said Soni. Both of them ran to the kitchen. “Wait for me!” said Raghu Mama, right behind them, finally off his favourite chair.Virtual Reality Bytes . The term “Virtual Reality” was first used in  in a science fiction story called The Judas Mandala by Damien Broderick. . Virtual Reality (VR) is made by very powerful computers that can use the small screens inside goggles to create a threedimensional (D) world that looks and feels very much like a real world. . VR goggles also have sensors in them that detect how your eyes are moving. For example, if you look up, the picture in the goggles changes to what you would see if you were looking up in real life. So if you were in a jungle, like Amish, and looking up, the screen would show you a sky instead of the forest.. Virtual Reality is not just used for playing games and exploring new worlds. It can also be used to train people for difficult jobs, like getting remote robots to do surgery. Firefighters can use VR to practise rescuing people from burning buildings, and astronauts can practise living in space and exploring new worlds. Imagine being able to understand what walking on Mars would be like before even setting foot inside a spaceship! . Are VR goggles safe for kids to use? Most scientists believe it has the same effect as watching a small screen like a mobile phone, so we need to be careful about how much and how long we use it.	./Story text files/133.txt	5020	16	5.598920863309353	467	89	190	43.04385964912281	78	36	34	9.087719298245615	67	47	336	220	5	1.3990825688073394	595	59
Grandpa was writing a letter. Ritu stood beside him, leaning on the arm of the old chair. “Grandpa, have you asked Aunty to send Mani to our home for the holidays?”“Of course, dear Ritu, I have written to your Aunty. Look here, let me read out the letter  Dear Pooja, Hope you are fine. Mani must be having holidays now. Ritu is very eager to see him. Do send him here to Tumkur.”Ritu jumped up and down. And since she could not stop herself, she ran around the room once and hugged Grandpa. “Would you like to post this letter yourself?” asked Grandpa. Ritu’s eyes opened wide. “All by myself? Oh, may I?”“Yes, little Ritu. See, I have written the address. Take it to the Post Office. Give the postcard to Ramesh Uncle. You do know that big uncle with the big, handlebar moustaches, don’t you?” “Yes Grandpa. He is the uncle who taught Mani how to ride the cycle last summer. Will he take the letter to Aunty Pooja?” asked Ritu. “No, dear. But the letter will reach your aunty, don’t worry.”Ritu picked up her little pink bag. She put the postcard inside. She put a pencil inside too. She felt very important. Ritu felt very grownup. And just a wee bit scared: what if Bageera the dog chased her? But Ritu was very eager to post the letter. So she left for the post office that was just four buildings away!After taking a few steps, Ritu stopped and took out the letter. She could not read Grandpa’s handwriting very well. She tried to remember what Grandpa had read. Then, after the word that she thought was ‘Tumkur’ Ritu wrote, ‘PLEECE. ’ Happy with her work, Ritu walked on.After she had reached the next building, Ritu stopped and took out the postcard once again. What if Pooja Aunty did not realise how eager Ritu was to see Mani? So Ritu took out her pencil again and wrote, ‘PLEEEESE. ’Finally, Ritu reached the small post office. There was a red post box outside the post office. Ritu could not reach the mouth of the post box even if she stood on her toes.She walked boldly up to Uncle Ramesh. He took the postcard from her and smiled. “Smart girl! Now run back to your house carefully. I shall make sure your letter reaches your aunty.” But Ritu did not run out. She saw Uncle Ramesh pick up a pen and scribble something on the card. Then he gave it to the postman who was stamping many letters with the postmark.Dhhum, dhhum, DHHUM, he pounded on the letters. When he saw Ritu's letter, he stopped. Then he smiled. He picked out a pencil from behind his ear and wrote something on the card.Five days passed. The postman brought a letter to Grandpa. Grandpa read it with a smile. “Ritu, your aunty says she will send Mani here day after. Let me read out the letter. Dear Father… tara. . . ra. . . ra. . . da. . . ta. . . da. . . da. . . dada. . . I am sending Mani tomorrow. He will reach Tumkur on Friday. I think Ritu must be very eager to see him. Your letter was very interesting…”“Grandpa, I wrote ‘PLEECE’ on the letter, that’s why!” said Ritu in excitement. “…. Your postcard had twenty ‘Please’s written all over it!”Ritu did not know how one ‘please’ had become twenty. She was just happy she had added one ‘PLEECE’ And another ‘PLEEEESE! ’Pleese Pleece PLEASE PLIS pleej pleece Please pleej PLIS pleece PLEASE Pleeese PLEASE	./Story text files/104.txt	3247	22	5.414364640883978	310	52	90	32.833333333333336	70	26	18	7.270833333333333	61	35	204	158	6	1.2323462414578588	422	17
The tank in Ranj’s village was almost dry. Ajji began to pray for rain. Amma collected all the buckets and pots and vessels in the house and filled them up. “We need to store as much water as we can,” she said. Appa collected tools to dig a little deeper. “We just need enough until the rains arrive,” he said.Ranj got out her notebook and pencil. She put on her thinking cap, and followed her parents to the tank. She examined the tank bed closely. It was cracked and dusty. Ranj wondered, “Where did the water in the tank go? Did it run away? Was it stolen? This is a mystery!”Ranj loved solving mysteries: Like the time Ajji couldn’t find her reading glasses. Ranj had found them in her book, marking the page she was reading. Then the other time — Why were elephants visiting the ragi fields? Turns out it was because their long, long trunks could smell the ripening grains, all ready to eat. “I’ll find that water,” Ranj muttered to herself.Ranj walked to the other side of the tank, past dead fish and dried reeds. “Do you know where the water could have gone?” Ranj asked a fisherman. “Downstream?” the fisherman suggested.Ranj followed the dry stream bed down the hill. At the bottom was another tank. It had lots of goats, but no water. Ranj asked the goatherd, “Do you know where the water might be?” “Upstream,” the goatherd suggested. “That’s where I came from,” Ranj said. “No water there.” “Further up, then?” the goatherd said. “That’s where your water comes from.”Ranj climbed up to the tank. Then she climbed up some more to a tank further up the hill. There was no water, no birds. There was only one person there. “Sapna, I can’t find any water. Any idea where it’s gone?” Ranj called to her. She knew Sapna from school.“Downstream,” Sapna called back. Ranj was suddenly angry. She stomped her foot. “NO!” she shouted. “It’s not. I have searched and searched. It’s not upstream or downstream. Got it?” “How about up there?” Sapna suggested. Ranj and Sapna looked up at the sky. The sun glared back at them. Everything was whitehot and dusty. “No,” they agreed together. “No water there.”Ranj collapsed into the boat with Sapna and gnawed on a lotus stem. She was hot and tired. “Manju’s parents left the village,” Ranj said. “They went to the city where they have water. Maybe we should all go.”“You go,” Sapna snapped. “No one asked you to be here.” “Fine,” Ranj said. And she stomped back home. But it wasn’t fine! There was still no water, still no rain. The next day, Ranj brushed her teeth with muddy tank water in a tiny glass. “Thooo!” she spat. In school, the class was halfempty. More families had left the area.Ranj just couldn’t bear it. She missed all her friends! In the middle of Environmental Studies class, she turned and ran out of school.She ran and ran until she was panting. She finally sat at the side of the road. “I have to find the water!” she huffed. “Can I help?” said a voice. It was Sapna who had seen Ranj running away from school. Ranj beamed. “Yes!” “We have to do this properly,” Sapna said. “Like real Sanitary Engineers.” “Like who…?” Ranj asked. “Sanitary Engineers build pipes and tanks and drains. I am going to be one when I grow up,” Sapna said. Ranj and Sapna decided to draw a map of their village and all its tanks and streams, showing all the places where the water might have flowed.Where could the water possibly have gone? Finally, they sat back and pored over the map. “We haven’t seen that tank yet,” Ranj pointed to one of the tanks they had drawn. “Let’s go,” Sapna agreed. Ranj and Sapna began climbing up the hill. The stream here was dry as well. “Maybe we shouldn’t have missed school. This tank is probably dry as well,” Sapna said sadly.When they reached the tank, Ranj and Sapna realised they were wrong. This tank was full!Sapna pointed at a small pump at the end of the lake. There was a tanker just below the bund, collecting water as it flowed. A man stood by, guiding the tanker. “Mystery solved,” Ranj spat. She had never felt so angry after solving a mystery.“Where are you taking our water?” Ranj wanted to know. “The city,” the man said. “They have more people, so they need more water.” “That’s not fair!” Sapna said. The man shrugged, “That’s how it is.” “My friend is a Sanitary Engineer,” Ranj yelled. “She knows what’s fair.” The man laughed. “Sanitary Engineer it seems! You’re just children!” Sapna said quietly, “Yes, but I know you can’t just take our water away.” “Go home,” the man said. “You can’t change anything!”“We’ll break your pump!” Ranj shouted, running at the pump with a stick. “Oho!” said the man. “Shouldn’t Sanitary Engineers be building pumps, not breaking them?” “Yes… no… not like this…” Sapna said, unhappily. But Ranj said, “I’m a detective! I can do what I want.”Ranj had a better idea. She hugged the pump. “You can’t turn it on now!” Sapna ran up to hug the pump too. “Hey!” said the man. Now he was really angry. “Just go home,” he said.That was when the clouds broke. Thunder roared, lightning slashed, rain poured. Sapna started to laugh. “The monsoon is here!” Ranj shouted. “I’m going home, even if you aren’t,” the tanker man said. It rained and rained.WOOSH, the bund overflowed, and the stream rushed down, splashing them. “The water has been found! Mystery solved!” Ranj said. “WOOOOOO!” They yowled with joy.Water Words Tank: A name for a manmade place to collect water. Tank sizes can vary from small pools to large lakes. Bund: A small wall – usually made of mud or stones – to stop and hold water in a tank.Stream: A small channel through which water flows. Spring: A place where underground water comes up to the surface. Water table: Level of water under the ground. Wells have to be dug deep enough to hit the water table to get water.	./Story text files/76.txt	5769	20	5.711538461538462	515	109	142	35.0625	127	33	28	7.44375	108	52	345	279	5	1.2941952506596306	701	57
"“Foooo! Foooo!” Anna Mani blew out all eight candles on her birthday cake. ""Happy Birthday, Anna! "" shouted her brothers and sisters. Anna had a big family and a big house on a hill. But on her birthday, she had only one small wish.Anna tore open her birthday gift and peered in. There was something sparkling inside. “Diamond earrings? Aiyye!” She did not want diamond earrings. They were expensive and useless! Do you know what Anna really wished for? Books, books and more books!“We have books at home!” said her brother. But Anna had already read those. “There are more in the library!” pointed out her grandfather. But Anna had read those too! She marched into her room. “Hmmph!”Later that day, there was a knock on Anna’s door. But there was nobody outside! Instead, there lay a big box at her doorstep. “This better not be more jewellery!” she said loudly. It wasn’t. It was a brand new set of Encyclopaedia books! “So many books. Hurray!” Anna ran around her house, hugging everyone.Many years later, and many, many, many books later, Anna found a job in the laboratory of a famous scientist. “What should I do here?” asked Anna. The scientist pointed to a box. What do you think she found inside?“Diamonds? Aiyyyye!” said Anna. But this time, the diamonds were not to be worn. They were for experiments. The scientist wanted Anna to find out what makes diamonds shine. So she read books about diamonds. Books, books and more books!Being a scientist was the best! She could study anything she wanted. Anna did like things that shine. And what shines brighter than diamonds? The sun! So Anna read books about the sun, sunlight and the weather. Books, books and more books!Anna did hundreds of experiments. She built many gadgets that could measure the weather of a place.How sunny is it in Bombay? Anna built a gadget to measure that. How windy is it in Madras? Anna built a gadget for that too.Her favourite gadget took many months to build. It is a special balloon called an ozonesonde. It has a small machine fixed to it. The machine can measure a gas found in air called ozone. It can fly really high. Look, there goes Anna’s ozonesonde!Guess how many gadgets Anna Mani built in all? Nearly one hundred weather gadgets! She even had her own factory where these were made. It was as if she could build anything!Anna Mani became one of the wisest weather scientists in India. Even as she grew older and more well known, her best friends remained the same. Books, books and more books!Life & Times of Anna: A Timeline  August,   Anna Mani is born in Peermedu in Kerala.   She gets a scholarship to work at CV Raman’s laboratory in Bangalore.   She leaves for England to study Meteorology.   She returns and joins the Indian Meteorological Department in Pune.  She starts work on the ozonesonde project.   She retires as Deputy Director General of the Indian Meteorological department. In the s (exact year unknown)  She starts her own company to manufacture her gadgets.  August,   Anna Mani passes away in Kerala.Wonderful Weather Words Meteorologist (say it like this: ‘meetyourallo jist’): A meteorologist is a scientist who studies the weather and climate of a region. Anna Mani was one of the best meteorologists there ever was! Ozonesonde (say it like this: ‘ohzonesond’): Ozonesondes are balloons which fly high up into the sky. The balloons have gadgets fixed to them which measure the amount of ozone present in the air. Ozone is important because it blocks out harmful light coming from the sun. Too little ozone high up in in the sky means we are in trouble!

He loves the leaves and flowers and trees.He helps with the compost, and works with his Grandpa all day. Amir helps to water the plants.When they finish, they feast on a harvest of fruit. One day, Grandpa didn’t eat his pear. “What’s wrong?” asked Amir.“My garden is dying,” replied Grandpa. “Why?” asked Amir. “Look closely,” said Grandpa. “Some pests are eating the plants.”“We need ladybirds!” said Grandpa. “They are the bugs that eat the pests that kill the plants. Without ladybirds, the garden will die.” “I’ll bring you a bug or two,” said Amir.For a whole week, Amir looked and searched and collected. He found one ladybird on the sports field.Two more at the shop. Three at the park.And four behind the TV. Next week, Amir went to visit Grandpa Farouk, and showed him his jar of ten bugs. “You’ve done well, oh my boy, you’ve done well,” Grandpa said, with a tear in his eye.Grandpa was very happy. The ladybirds were very hungry!The ladybirds ate the pests, and the garden blossomed.From that day on, Grandpa Farouk’s garden did what gardens should do. It grew and grew and grew.	./Story text files/400.txt	1218	14	5.895522388059701	108	26	94	37.09375	23	9	18	7.53125	20	12	72	62	3	1.3227848101265822	149	9

Dipa loved to jump. She loved to climb trees. And most of all, she loved to run and play with her Puja Didi.Dipa lived in Agartala, the capital of Tripura. Agartala is green and beautiful with agarwood trees and pineapple, orange and litchi orchards.Her Baba was a national weightlifting champion. On most days, she went with him to the gymnasium, where he was a coach.Ma and Baba wanted both their daughters to take up sports. So, at the age of five, Dipa started training.Gymnastics is a lot like acrobatics and aerobics. Quick movements. Tumbling and soaring. Fluid twists and turns.Breathtaking somersaults on narrow beams, vaults and uneven bars! Gymnastics needs balance, lots of mental effort, and control over muscles. One false step can mean a bad fall. Or a broken leg or an injured back!Dipa started training. But she was so scared of falling, that she wouldn’t even step onto the beams. She threw tantrums and complained a lot.Baba believed that she would get over her fear. He was right!Wheeeee! Dipa was cartwheeling. Whoooosh! She was sailing through the air. Baba and her coach Soma Nandi were so happy.When Dipa turned nine, she participated in the balancing beam event in the  Northeastern Games. And guess what? Dipa won the gold medal! What a golden moment for her. This win meant a lot to her and Baba. She was no longer a reluctant gymnast.Dipa still had to work hard. She was flatfooted, which means that the soles of her feet didn’t have the usual natural curve. Flat feet affect how a gymnast runs, and how she lands on her feet during jumps. But Dipa had come so far — she decided she would not give up.Her coach Soma Nandi introduced her to Guruji, Bishweswar Nandi, who took over her training. Soon, she was doing special exercises that helped her feet develop an arch.Gymnastics has never been popular in India. It did not matter to Dipa that she did not have the best infrastructure or space to train in.Guruji created equipment with scooter parts to serve as springboards. Crash mats were piled on top of one another to become her vaulting platform, and seats from old cars became her landing space.Dipa’s days were busy! Dipa ran. She jumped. Twisted and turned. She did rolls and stands on her head. For eight hours a day.Her bones ached and her muscles were painfully sore. She was moody, hungry and very tired.Like most children, Dipa loved ice cream. But she was put on a strict diet.She sometimes had to live and train in a sports hostel, far from home. And on top of all of that, she had exams! Did she mind working so hard? No, she did not! All Dipa wanted was to win medals. And become the best.The years went by and Dipa won all the junior and national titles she competed in. However, she didn’t win anything at the  Commonwealth Games. Ashish Kumar became the first Indian gymnast to win medals at that event — it was a proud moment for India. Dipa was inspired by this win. She was determined to do better.Four years later, Dipa won the bronze at the  Glasgow Commonwealth Games. And also at the  Hiroshima Asian Gymnastics Championship. It was so thrilling to stand on the winners’ podium!So far, Dipa had won  medals, and that included  gold ones! But Guruji wanted her to make a mark in the international arena — she had to perfect something that hadn’t been attempted by most gymnasts. Something bold. And dangerous.Guruji trained her to do the Produnova vault. It was named after the first woman who mastered it — Yelena Sergeyevna Produnova. Only four other women in the world had landed this extremely dangerous manoeuvre.In , Dipa was  and she was ready to show her skills to the world at the Rio Olympics. The country waited eagerly to see her win a medal. And she missed! She missed winning a medal by just .  point.But her performance left everyone awestruck.As Dipa began training for the next Olympics, she also had a new plan up her sleeve. She wanted to create a new gymnastic manoeuvre.

What makes you sad?” The girl answered, “I am hungry.”The man was sorry for the girl. He told her there was a feast in the neighbourhood and she should go and steal food. The girl had never stolen before.The girl stood up quickly and went to the home that was holding the feast.When she got near, she forgot the instructions on how to steal. She sang repeatedly: I have come to steal food, food, I am walking slowly, slowlyPeople heard the song of the girl from far until she got into the homestead.People were amazed by the nature of the song and asked her, “Where do you come from? What do you want? Why are you singing?”The girl told them how hungry she was and they gave her food. Later, she was advised that stealing is bad!	./Story text files/20.txt	890	16	5.734939759036145	70	13	157	48.5	11	7	30	10.277777777777779	9	9	57	26	4	1.3263157894736841	85	10
"“Puchku! Have a bath!” “Puchku! Eat your food!”“Puchku! Go to class!” ""Puchku! Get on the bus!” “Puchku! Do your homework!”“Where is Puchku?”Puchku is busy. She has a book to read. Puchku reads all the time — at home, in school, in the park, in bed. Page after page, book after book, one by one, she has read them all.""Why are you always reading Puchku? "" asks Boltu. ""Come, watch a cartoon instead! "" says Dodla.""Books are so much more fun!” says Puchku. “Look! You see a circle? And this straight line? Push it in, pull that out, and it becomes a letter. Line up the letters, and you have a word! Words can be wise, words can be funny, words can be sad and words can be sunny. When you put words together, they make sentences. And sentences become stories. Read it and WHOOSH! You are in another world! ”But today, Puchku is in a fix. She has run out of books to read! All the books that she could reach in the library, she’s read from Chapter One to The End.""What will I do? No more books to read! "" wails Puchku.Wait! What’s that over there? Puchku looks up and sees not one, not two, but three more shelves, FULL of books. “More books!” Puchku whispers in delight.There is still one problem though. She is too short. And the bookshelf is too tall. How can Puchku get up there?Maybe she can use a washing line? Or Ma’s sari to climb? How about the chairs and tables in the room?It would really be helpful, thinks Puchku, to have a giraffe at hand. Even a monkey. Or both!Puchku has a plan. She calls Boltu and Dodla for help. As quiet as they can, they climb on top of each other. “Boltu, you’re heavy!” Dodla complains. “Told you not to eat that last rasgulla.” “It’s not me,” Boltu hisses. “It’s Puchku!” “Shh! Almost there,” says Puchku. Just then, it all goes wrong.AHHHHHHHH!“What is happening here?” It is the Very Tall Librarian! She puts Puchku down. Boltu and Dodla run away! Puchku looks up sadly at the book she almost had in her hand. “Can I help?” asks the Very Tall Librarian.“I was trying to climb the bookshelf. I have run out of books to read,” says Puchku, sadly. “Why didn’t you say so?” says the Very Tall Librarian. “As long as I am around, you do not have to climb a bookshelf. May I pick you up?” Puchku nods.“I will take this, and this, and this one too!” says Puchku happily. “Thank you!” “Take this one too,” says the Very Tall Librarian. “When I was small, I loved this book.”“You were small once?” Puchku asks. “Oh yes, even smaller than you,” says the Very Tall Librarian. “But then I grew, and so will you. Until then, all you need to do is ask for a book and I will be here to give it to you.”But is Puchku listening? No she is not! She is inside her book, through a circle and a line And a letter and another. Then a word! And another, A sentence. And another. And now a story.Because Puchku has a new book."	./Story text files/371.txt	2843	21	5.709342560553633	242	47	90	28.31958762886598	82	15	23	6.505154639175258	74	23	157	132	3	1.169398907103825	347	19
"From elephant to ant, we all need some. When I’m done, my tum says, “Yum! Yum! Yummmm!” Guess what this is? Yes! It is food! And food makes me go chew, chomp, yum!WHAT IS FOOD? Can an elephant walk through the forest without food? Can an ant leave its nest without a bite of food? Can you even breathe if you don’t eat food? We all need energy to read, play, eat, study and to live. Where does that energy come from?Plants get energy from the sun. Animals get energy from food like plants or other animals. Human beings eat different types of food. Some natural things that other creatures eat are not food for humans.""Sigh! I am my own kitchen! No one makes food for me! """"Yikes! Did I swallow a worm? "" ""That deer is so thin, I’m sure it is not eating much! ""THE TRUTH ABOUT TOOTH When you chew, the teeth break food into smaller bits that are easy to swallow. It also becomes easy for your stomach to draw out all the good things in food and turn them into energy. This is called digestion. The more you chew, the more saliva flows into your mouth. Saliva helps to digest food. Saliva cleans teeth and keeps them healthy. But you need to help your body stay healthy. When you chew things that are not food, like chewing gum or a pencil, your mouth sends a signal to your stomach that it is sending food down. The stomach gets ready to digest food.When it doesn't come, your stomach gets angry and upset! Ouch!Can we eat well if we have no teeth? When you’re taking a selfie, you flash your brightest smile, with your teeth showing. How many teeth do you have? Look closely at the teeth of an adult. There are thirtytwo teeth, of four different kinds. . Incisors  four flat in the centre  to bite food with. . Canine  to tear food. . Two premolars and three fat molars  to chew and grind food with.CHEW RIGHT Bite or break your food into smaller bits. This makes chewing easier. Chew carefully, slowly and pay attention to how you break the food down. Take the next bite only after you have swallowed the previous bite. Try not to talk while you are eating. You may choke.• Frogs, which have no teeth, swallow their food whole! • An African elephant has four molar teeth to chew with. • Chhurpi, a hard Himalayan cheese, can take hours to soften before you can chew it! • Cats hardly chew their food. But you are not a cat! So, do chew your food well.DID YOU KNOW? • Chewing food is good exercise for your jaws, tongue and gums. • Chewing gum on one side of the mouth can leave the other side weaker and even cause you pain. • Chewing hard food like sugarcane is good for the ears too and helps to keep the passage clean!TYPES OF FOOD Sportspersons like me because I have iron, potassium and vitamins. Calcium and iron make me super strong! Vitamins, minerals, proteins and carbohydrates we have it all!Protein, vitamins, fats we have it all! Manganese, magnesium and good fat make us a crunchy delight. Protein+Carbohydrates is a winning sum!MINERALS are important elements found naturally, important for the health of every cell in your body. VITAMINS are chemicals that cannot be made inside your body but are important for the health of your eyes, skin and hair. Some animals like bats, dogs and guinea pigs can make some vitamins they need.FATS are needed to keep us healthy and full of energy. Fat helps our bodies to absorb some vitamins. The fat in foods like burgers and chips is bad for our health. Animal products, cheese, nuts and oils contain good fat. Everyone needs some fat to stay healthy and to have energy.PROTEINS are to your body as bricks are to your house: they are the building blocks that are found in everything from hair to toenail. A mixed dal made of soybean, masur, moong and cow peas would be packed with protein! Proteins are found in milk, curd, cheese, animal products, beans, seeds, nuts, wheat, oats, brown rice and barley. Phew! CARBOHYDRATES are needed for energy. Starchy and sugary foods such as rice, sugar, potatoes give us carbohydrates. Too much of carbohydrates could be unhealthy. So, do eat less of cakes, jams, pizza!GREEN: Cabbage, spinach: fibre to clean your insides, calcium for bones. ORANGE: Carrots, pumpkin: good for eyes and skin.

Feel like eating something yummy and healthy? Try fruit salad made from guava, papaya, banana, water melon and other seasonal fruit that grow in your region. Add a dash of lemon and a pinch of rock salt for more health and taste.STRIKE A BALANCE Our body needs different kinds of nutrients. But no food contains all of them. That is why, even though you may want to eat paneer at every meal, you must eat different kinds of food like grains, vegetables, pulses, oil and butter. You must also take raw foods such as fruit and salads. If you put a food rainbow on your plate, the colour tells you what is in it for you.GOOD FOOD, NOTSOGOOD FOOD Some foods are good for you, and some are not so good for you.

Many years ago when Rumniya was a baby, Nana, Nani and Rumniya went to a wedding.There were hundreds of people at the party, most of whom were near the food. After some time, Nani lost Rumniya.When things get lost, Nani does not worry; she feels that everything will turn up, and turn out right very soon. So Nani did not feel worried.On the other hand, Rumniya was only one and a half years old, so she was quite worried and not as hopeful.But rather than doing any silly babylike things like crying, Rumniya thought of doing something else.In that vast crowd, it was impossible for a small girl to search for people's faces.In fact, it was much easier to search for the right person by looking at people's feet, their shoes and sandals.So that is what Rumniya did. She started from one end of the room.She lifted up the sari of each and every woman. Then she came to a sari that was familiar, and slippers that she knew. Sure enough, when Rumniya matched the face with the sari and slippers, it was Nani!And as Nani bent down to pick Rumniya up, Nani said to her friend, “See, I told you. There was nothing to worry about. Whenever you lose something, you will always find it.”	./Story text files/354.txt	1179	13	5.747826086956522	95	20	111	64.55555555555556	7	11	22	12.944444444444445	5	13	77	38	4	1.504201680672269	110	9

Although usually involving children, bullying has no limits of age, creed, or race, and can affect anyone. Recognition Generally, a child will not not tell anyone they are being bullied, often until it is too late, especially not an adult, unless there has been a prior relationship of trust built up. Some incidents of bullying in teenage years have resulted in death and suicide, and yet the child was still too afraid to speak out. Many teenagers and middlegraders will have mood swings, but it is really important as a parent, caregiver or concerned adult friend, that you monitor any out of character mood changes, or behavior changes and speak to the child concerned as soon as possible. Being available, being observant, and being a friend, can be your biggest methods of support for a child in difficulty. Confidence A confident child will shrug off or counteract bullying, and the bully will usually loose interest soon enough. It's no fun bullying someone that doesn't bite. Ensuring a child is sure of themselves, secure in their own self image, accepting of their abilities and disabilities, will mean they are less likely to be a victim of bullying, or if they are, they have the ability to deflect the attack and turn the situation to their advantage. Support If a child comes to you for support, it is vital that the situation is handled correctly. Incorrect handling can result in more subtle and more vicious bullying, which could be much more emotionally damaging than straight physical attacks. If it is the first time you have dealt with the issues seek advice and research the subject carefully. Both generically and personally, don't jump in feet first, especially if you are emotionally involved. Time taken to search a solution usually will result in a better solution for all. Prevention Start early by instilling confidence and trust with your child. Ensure they have a high self worth, and a high level of trust in you to share problems without fear of repercussions. This is harder than it sounds, but much easier than it is for a child to put up with bullying silently. If you start early and keep practicing, it will have rewards.

Vedika and Karan loved to huddle and read together on their grandfather’s rocking chair. “Look at the lion,” pointed Vedika. “It’s a very small picture. Fetch me Grandpa’s big looking glass,” said Karan.Karan moved the magnifying glass forward and back till he saw the lion look really huge. “Vedika! This lion is getting bigger and bigger!” “The lion is moving, Karan!” screamed Vedika.Just then, Karan and Vedika put down the looking glass and found themselves standing in front of a huge, big lion.The lion opened its wide mouth and let out a, “Miiaaooww!” “What’s wrong Mr. Lion? Why do you sound like a cat?” asked Vedika.“My cousin, the cat and I met at the lake yesterday and when we drank water from the lake, I got her miaow and she got my roar,” said the lion.“This is terrible, Mr. Lion. Where can we find your cousin, the cat?” asked Karan. “Sitting on some tree and scaring the birds I think,” replied the lion. “Vedika, let’s help the lion get his roar back,” said Karan.“Come with us Mr. Lion,” said Vedika. Just then they heard the roar they were looking for. They searched and searched till they found the cat sitting high up on a tree.“Miss Cat, you have a loud roar,” said Vedika. “Yes, I do. And, the lion has my tiny miaow,” replied the cat. “Now I can scare all the birds and animals.”“Mr. Lion needs his roar back. Please give it back to him,” begged Karan.

This story is about an uncle named Sandy, Who likes his camera so much, he always keeps it handy. Let's rewind to when Uncle Sandy was a little boy, Unlike his friends, he never dreamt of a fancy toy.Lost in books that spoke of magical creatures, Even in class, he never listened to his teachers. As time passed by, Uncle Sandy became a wildlife photographer, While his friends became doctors, engineers and dance choreographers.Uncle Sandy didn't want to work in big offices, He wanted to take pictures of snakes, crocodiles and tortoises. So he decided to leave his family and friends behind, And took off to the jungles with freedom in mind. On his first expedition to the Western Ghats, He had his first encounter with a mysterious cat. Uncle Sandy has been on its trail ever since, Hoping to click a picture of it, for evidence.So he decided to revisit the Western Ghats, Through its spiraling path in search of the cat. The cat in the ghat! The plan was to speak to animals along the way, To get clues about this cat whose colour he knew was grey.He began his journey at the foothills of the Ghats, With the summer sun so hot, Uncle Sandy needed a hat. “Let’s look for waterholes,” he said to himself, He knew that’s where the animals would tread.And guess who he got to meet, The top cat himself, Mr. Tiger to greet. “Oh mighty tiger,” he said, “would you have seen a cat? It is tall, swift and the colour of my hat.” The tiger didn’t have much to say, He roared and looked the other way.Phew! That was close, he thought, Just as he was drenched by giant rain drops. Along with the shower came a swarm of termites, Who were sadly eaten by ants, at first sight.Rains in the Western Ghats come down as waterfalls, Waterfalls become rivers and that's how there's water for all. So, if we need water to drink, Protecting the Western Ghats is the link.What Uncle Sandy saw next filled him with glee, A family of elephants bathing in a pond, yippee! They were making the most of the premonsoon showers, Some were kicking grass, others showing off their powers. “Excuse me you all,” said Uncle Sandy, waving his hat, “Would you have seen a big grey cat?”“No, no, no,” they all went in chorus, “We haven’t seen him around here, we promise.” Uncle Sandy found himself in the rainforest soon, “The second level of the Western Ghats,” he crooned. “Bark!” came a reply through the forest dense. “Oh that’s a Barking Deer I hear, it means no offence.”Up in the trees chomping through a jackfruit, He saw a lionfaced monkey, brute. A Liontailed Macaque is what it is, he knew, He’d looked through an encyclopedia of animals, woohoo! “Help me find a grey cat, will you?” said Uncle Sandy. “Okay,” said the feasting monkey.“Walk straight through the tall green trees Till you find one with a giant hive of bees.” “Under that tree lives a frog so rare It lives underground, hiding from the sun’s glare.” “He’s a clever frog I’m told, Knows the whole jungle inside out and twofold.” Uncle Sandy was so eager to look for the froggy He left without saying thank you to the monkey.Left, right, left, right, Uncle Sandy marched, Walking through a row of trees that were arched. Then he saw a tree very tall With a big beehive that was just about to fall.“Ribbit ribbit,” said a frog, But Uncle Sandy could not see it through the fog. “Oh you’re the man who comes in search of a cat, I heard about you from a clever little bat.” Said Uncle Sandy, “Please will you tell me where he is? I’ll give you an exotic flower, an Iris.”The frog was purple in colour, He’s the only one of his kind in India, Nasika batracus. The frog told him that he’d meet a tribesman, Who’d know where the cat lived, and would guide him. Uncle Sandy nodded, still in shock, He had just seen the most extraordinary frog.As he went further into the forests so thick, He saw that the trees were getting fewer very quick. “People cut trees,” he said, “to make products very cheap, And the poor animals, they have no place to sleep.” “These jungles are their homes you see, just like our houses back in the city.” Sad and disheartened by the state of affairs, Uncle Sandy decided to say a silent prayer.“Protect these forests, oh dear God, please, Save them so the animals can live in peace.” Saying so he carried on, the high altitude grasslands waiting, And that’s where he’d find the cat from its hiding.The remotest of places in the whole of the Western Ghats, The grasslands so green, Uncle Sandy just sat. Staring at the miracle of creation and the beauty of this place, This, he felt, was really his land of fairy tales. Pat came a tap on his back, He turned to see a face painted black.“Who are you, Sir?” Uncle Sandy questioned “I am a tribesman who lives here unquestioned.” “Oh but sir, will you be as kind To answer one question I have on my mind? “Where can I find the special cat I’m looking for? I’ve seen it only once before.”“Are you talking about Pogeyan?” he said. Uncle Sandy wasn’t sure what he meant. “The cat that comes and goes as the mist, Are you referring to that elusive cat that exists?” “Yes Sir, that’s the one,” Uncle Sandy affirmed. He was so happy he could’ve drummed and hummed. “Aha!” said the tribesman, pointing to the mountains higher up, “I’ve seen the cat over there, all of three times in close up.”Uncle Sandy was feeling extremely blessed. He did a somersault that left the tribesman perplexed. Uncle Sandy was whistling to himself, and climbing When he saw two male Nilgiri Tahrs headbutting. Looking at how well they'd adapted to the terrain, Uncle Sandy wished he too was born on the mountains.Sure he’d find his cat somewhere around here, Uncle Sandy decided to put camera traps all over. Then he slept a good night’s sleep Under an open twinkling sky, on a hillock steep. When he woke up, he ran to his camera traps and checked. Yes, yes, yes, there were images of his cat! ! The cat in the ghat!The cat looked the same as it did ten years ago, Uncle Sandy was happy, ho, ho, ho! That’s when he felt a tiny snake crawling over his feet. He was startled, and realised he’d been dreaming in his sleep. Uncle Sandy prayed his dream would come trueHope he finds his grey cat soon, don’t you?The Cat in the Ghat is a whimsical tale of Uncle Sandy going in search of a mysterious cat in the Western Ghats. It has been inspired by the reallife expedition by Sandesh Kadur, a National Geographic Emerging Explorer, wildlife filmmaker and conservation photographer.

One hot day, little Tone sits with the other cloud droplets and looks down from the sky. Everything looks so interesting from way up here in the clouds. The trees look like little soft green balls. The rivers look like silver ribbons. The mountain tops look like ice cream scoops. The buildings look like little grey boxes.“What else is down there?” Tone asks her friend Nyunyu. “My daddy says there are people and animals and trees and cars,” says Nyunyu. “Wow! So much to see!” says Tone.As the day carries on, their friend Ms Sun rises higher and higher in the sky until Tone and Nyunyu and the other droplets cannot see her anymore.Mr Wind comes along whistling a sweet, sweet tune. His whistles blow Tone and Nyunyu and their droplet friends off their cloud. “Brr!” says Tone. It’s getting very cold.Mr Wind keeps whistling and Tone and Nyunyu and the other droplets fall onto another cloud. BOOP! They bounce off the cloud and then fall far, far towards the earth.“Look at me fall, Nyunyu. I’m going faster than you!” says Tone and she races with Nyunyu to see who will be the fastest. They fall past clouds and birds and very tall buildings.Down, down, down they go. Faster and faster. “ Look at that, Tone. What is it?” says Nyunyu. “Hmm, I see red and orange, yellow and green, blue and purple,” says Tone.“It looks like a big ball!” says Nyunyu.“It looks like a rainbow!” says Tone.Down, down, down they fall. “Whee!” “Whee!”Swoosh! They slide down the big, bouncy, colourful thing. “It’s an umbrella!” shout Tone and Nyunyu.	./Story text files/426.txt	1535	15	5.5	154	24	145	34.72093023255814	33	10	28	7.232558139534884	29	14	115	63	4	1.1805555555555556	208	8
When Ana moved from her hometown in Goa to Mumbai, she was very excited. But she was also sorry to leave her uncle, her grandmother, her friends and most of all… Mando.Mando was a serious dog who slept peacefully all day. But whenever there was a wedding in the neighbourhood, he howled woefully, until Ana’s uncle stopped playing his violin! Ana loved Mando. She knew he would always protect her from strangers and dangers. And from her uncle’s noisy violin!Mumbai was a noisy city. Ana missed the sounds of the birds, the church bells and the village music. The only thing she didn’t miss was her uncle’s violin! Sometimes, after school, Ana would go with her father as he delivered letters and parcels.Ana would wait eagerly for her ride up in the lift. One day, she sneakily pressed all the buttons. The lift opened on every floor! Every floor had a red speaker box on the wall. Each floor also had a strangelooking showerhead on the ceiling. ‘Who would want to take a bath here? ’ she wondered.Ana tried to figure things out. The red speaker box never played any music. And the shower? Not a drop of water ever dripped from it. It did not even have a tap!One afternoon, while Ana and her father were on the fifth floor at Manju Aaji’s door, they heard the most horrible wailing. “Papa, what’s that terrible noise?” “I think that’s the fire alarm, Ana. Come, we must get to the fire escape floor immediately.”Ana looked at all the people who had rushed to the safety point. “Don’t worry Ana, it’s a very small fire on the second floor. Do you hear that siren? That’s the fire engine  it’s here to help us.” Suddenly, the strange shower began to spray water all around.Oh, and who was that in the corner? Manju Aaji’s kitten! She was terrified of the fire and the water.The sight of the helpless little kitten made Ana feel brave. She dashed to its rescue. Now that she had gathered some courage, she asked, “How did the shower come on, Papa?”“These are fire sprinklers, Ana. When there is a fire, they turn on automatically,” her father said. “But where is the tap, Papa?” she asked again. Ana’s father looked at the sprinkler. He wasn’t sure.“There is no tap, Ana,” said Manju Aaji. “That red pipe is always full of water and is plugged tight with a bulb. When there’s a fire nearby, the bulb heats up and bursts. So the water comes rushing out.” “Ah,” said Papa, who had just learnt something.BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP. . . A large white ladder rose up right in front of them. “Families with children and the elderly, please,” a fireman announced into his horn.As they climbed onto the fire lift, Manju Aaji clutched Ana’s hand, and shut her eyes tight. But Ana kept her eyes wide open. “You were a brave girl today, Ana,” her father said proudly. “Did the fire alarm scare you?” Ana hugged him and nodded. “The fire alarm saved us all today, you know? It’s a good thing,” he said softly. “It’s a bit like Mando, Papa,” Ana whispered back. Her father looked puzzled. “The fire alarm is quiet every day. It only makes noise to save us from trouble.”Technology helps us in many ways. During a fire, the automatic fire systems in schools, cinema halls and other buildings save our lives. Here are some things we should do when we hear a fire alarm: . Get up calmly and walk towards the nearest fire exit at a steady pace. Do not take the lift as lifts are usually disabled during a fire.. Running will make you inhale more smoke or may cause an accident or stampede. So do not run; walk fast. If possible, cover your face with a wet towel. . Do not throw any water at the fire as this could make the fire spread or cause electrocution. . Ask a grownup to switch off the electrical main switch. Do not touch any electrical appliances or switches. . If the exit way is filled with smoke it is better to crawl or creep out so that you inhale less smoke. . Once out of the building, walk towards the nearest fire assembly point or safe open area. . Wait in one place until your family member or caretaker has found you. . If you are injured, request the nearest grownup for help.	./Story text files/527.txt	4072	19	5.621867881548975	375	64	122	45.28409090909091	51	37	23	9.477272727272727	40	48	268	171	6	1.3965183752417796	470	47
"That morning, Kaushik felt like a real detective. After all, he had just got a shiny new torch and a magnifying glass from the local store.His grandpa had said to him, ""Kaushik, you look like a true detective today. I wonder what you are going to find! "" Kaushik was very excited as he walked briskly towards the forest near their farm.He looked at the wet grass and said to himself, ""Hmm. . . I think it has just rained in this place. ""The torch and the magnifying glass were great. He had already found his first clue. Not bad for a first time detective! Just then, he noticed a few red objects on the grass. What could these be?They looked like mushrooms. But, should a detective accept that? He wanted to be absolutely certain. So he tiptoed around these objects, took out his magnifying glass and looked closely. Wonders of wonders! He saw a tiny girl sitting there, under an umbrella.Kaushik looked at her through his magnifying glass. He asked, in a brave voice, ""Who are you? What are you doing here? "" The tiny girl got frightened by his loud voice and eyes, which looked enormous behind the magnifying glass. She let go of her umbrella and leaned back in fear.Through the magnifying glass, Kaushik could see her expressions clearly. She looked worried. So he told her, kindly, ""Don’t worry, I won’t hurt you. I want to be your friend. ""She stared at him for few minutes and asked softly, ""Is it still raining? "" ""No, the rain stopped long ago. There is no need for an umbrella now. You can also ask your friends to close their umbrellas, "" said Kaushik.The girl climbed on top of Kaushik’s hat and gave him a warm smile. ""My name is Lalitha. I live in this forest along with my family. We don’t know how to build a house. So when it rains, we use our umbrellas to protect ourselves from the shower. """"I can teach you and your family how to build a house. My father says that I could be a great architect someday, "" said Kaushik. With that, Kaushik’s detective dream came to an end, and the next dream began."	./Story text files/261.txt	2017	16	5.683962264150943	172	40	109	47.04761904761905	23	19	20	9.833333333333334	17	25	147	65	5	1.3636363636363635	212	30
My name is Shyam, I am ten years old. I am a little skinny, but very bold! Waking up for school is no fun at all I am so sleepy as I get up, I think I will fall.My eyes close as I begin to brush, I hear Amma making dosas in a rush. My mind slowly begins to wander away, And many, many ideas come into play.What if my neck was ten times as long? Half in school, half at home, where would I belong?What if my legs were as tall as trees? My school building would only come up to my knees!What if my arms were strong enough? Then, lifting Amma would not be tough!What if there was nothing too hard for my teeth? Think of all the things I could eat!What if my belly was as round as could be? All my friends could jump and bounce off me!What if I had big and floppy ears? I could hear everything, far and near!What if — I begin, but Amma shouts, “Shyam, you’ll be late, what are you thinking about?”I find myself still standing with my brush in my hand, And I smile and think of my secret little land.	./Story text files/230.txt	995	11	5.4326923076923075	93	11	102	48.8	13	7	23	11.05	5	15	71	33	4	1.2053571428571428	111	1
Nani keeps losing her glasses. “Where did I keep them?” she always asks. Without her glasses, she cannot find her glasses.So she needs me. To be her eyes, to find her own eyes!Sometimes her spectacles are in the bathroom. Or on her bed. Or on her head. “Nani,” I say, “they are on your head!”“Of course! How silly of me. Thank you, Richa dear,” she says with a giggle. This time, though, I cannot find Nani’s glasses. Not yet.I have looked everywhere. In all the usual places. On her head, in the bathroom, inside her cupboard, and on the puja shelf. I have looked under her favourite chair and on the dining table. Nothing. No glasses. Where could they be ?I decided to be a good detective. I decided to find out what she had done all day.“I did nothing much today. Except that Veena’s motherinlaw came, you know. And how much she gossips! We had many cups of tea. And she ate all the laddoos your mother had made,” said Nani.Raju said, “Nani was very busy today. She wrote a letter to the Chief Minister about her pension.”Amma said, “She spoke for a long time to your Masi. She finished knitting the sweater for Raju. And then she went for a short walk.” I now had many clues. I quickly looked around new places in the house. Aha! I have found the missing glasses!The spectacles were wrapped in wool, kept next to her pen, under the phone, on her desk. And I found a halfeaten laddoo there as well. For Nani's next birthday, I will save money for an extra pair of glasses!

Reeti’s holidays have begun. But Reeti isn’t happy. She doesn’t like holidays. She likes going to school! In school Reeti has lots of friends. At home she has no one to play with.She has a Papa who brings her toys and books and tells her stories. Reeti likes that. Her Papa does yoga every morning. Reeti likes that too and tries to imitate him.She has a Mummy who writes poetry and works on a computer. Reeti likes looking at the computer with Mummy. She also likes looking at Mummy’s tummy! Mummy’s tummy is getting big and round. Because there is a baby in it. “Soon you’ll have a little brother or sister to play with,” says Mummy. Reeti likes that. But right now, she has no one to play with. Not one of her friends lives close by.Then one evening the doorbell rings. Their neighbour Das Uncle is standing outside holding a brightgreen parrot in a black cage. “We are leaving town,” says Das Uncle. “Would you like to have our Mithu as a pet? He can talk!” Papa and Mummy look at each other. They don’t think birds should be in cages. But Reeti is very excited. “Yes, Uncle!” she says, with a big smile. And so Mithu becomes Reeti’s new friend.“Hello Mithu!” says Reeti. Mithu looks at her. “Hello!” he says. “Hello!” Reeti is thrilled. “What’s your name?” she asks. “Hello,” says the parrot. “No,” says Reeti. “Your name is Mithu. Say Mithu.” “Hello,” says Mithu.“No! No!” says Reeti, shaking her head. “Let’s try again. My name is Reeti. Mithu, listen carefully. My name is Reeti. What is my name?” “Hello,” says Mithu. “NO!” Reeti laughs. “Mithu, you are a naughty boy!” Every day Reeti tries to teach Mithu new words. “Say Papa. Say Mummy. Say Reeti.” But all Mithu says is, “Hello.”One day, Mummy takes Reeti across town to her friend’s birthday party. Reeti meets all her friends and enjoys herself. She brings back a piece of birthday cake for Mithu.BUT – where is he? “Mummy, where’s Mithu?” cries Reeti, running from room to room. “I don’t know,” says Mummy. “But don’t worry. We’ll find him.”Just then Papa walks in, with Mithu in his cage. “Hello!” says Mithu. “I took your friend to the park for some fresh air,” says Papa. Reeti is so relieved! She gives Mithu the birthday cake. But he doesn’t like it.Just as Reeti’s holidays are coming to an end, a flock of green parrots come flying to the big tree outside her window. They are all squawking and talking loudly.Mithu goes mad inside his cage, which Reeti has now placed near the window. He squawks, he jumps up and down and spreads his wings. Reeti watches. “Are they your friends, Mithu?” she asks. Mithu doesn’t answer. He only looks at the parrots on the tree.As swiftly as they had come, the parrots fly away. “What were they saying, Mithu?” Reeti asks. “Hello,” says Mithu sadly. “Hello.”Reeti’s holidays are over. It is the first day of school. Reeti meets all her friends and teachers. During the lunch break she plays happily with her friends. The big trees around the school playground are full of twittering birds.When Reeti reaches home after school, she sees Mithu sitting quietly in his cage. “Hello, Mithu,” she whispers. He looks at her but doesn’t say anything.Reeti puts down her schoolbag. She opens the window. Then she opens the door of the cage. “Go, Mithu!” she says. “Go and find your friends.” He looks at her. “Go, Mithu!” she says again. “Fly away!”Mithu steps out of his cage. He looks at Reeti one last time. And with a final “hello” , he spreads his wings and flies away to join his friends.WHO NEEDS A PET? Anyone who wants a loving and loyal friend needs a pet. If you're feeling lonely and lost or mean and mad, a pet is sure to do something. . . anything to make you glad. A pet will play with you, make you feel better, teach you lots of important things, and bring endless fun into your life. Now, who doesn't want that? SHOULD YOU HAVE A PET OR NOT? Sure, pets are fun, but don’t rush out to get one! Think carefully:  Will your parents let you keep a pet?  Do you really want a pet? Remember, a pet is for life. It is not a toy you can throw away once you get bored with it.  Pets need food, clean water, exercise, and love. They also have to be trained, taken to the vet, and given baths. That means extra work, every single day. Do you have the time for that?  Can you forgive your pet if it makes a mess with its muddy paws, or chews your favourite shoes?AM I REALLY READY FOR A PET? Your best friend has a pet, and you wish you had one too! So you’re wondering whether you should get a dog, a cat, or maybe, even a rat. Stop right there, before you pick a pet, and ask yourself these questions. Do I have the time to take care of a pet? Having a pet is a huge responsibility. Whether it is for training, feeding or plain loving, you’ve got to spend time on your pet – big time! Do I have space at home for a pet? Small pets like cats, fish and birds can adapt to houses of any size. But dogs may need more space to run around and exercise.What kind of pet do I want? If you want a specific kind of pet, talk to a vet or to people who own similar pets. Find out what they eat and how they behave. Then think hard about whether the pet will suit you. Can I afford to have a pet? All pets require food and shelter. Then, there are the visits to the vet for checkups, vaccinations, and for treatment when the pet falls ill. Will a pet be welcome at home? You may love animals, but do the rest of the family share your feelings? You need to talk this through with your family before you get a pet.	./Story text files/125.txt	5505	15	5.444628099173554	532	73	121	35.223684210526315	119	33	24	7.7894736842105265	101	51	358	247	6	1.2300275482093663	691	35

I love going for walks. Especially with my Pishi.I like it when Pishi holds my hand. But I like it even more… when she lets it go.We never walk fast. We often stop to say hello to…a dog, a cat, a rat, a crow, a tree.Pishi loves picking up flowers from the street. I love picking up stones.

Meera runs up the hill, past the river and the trees. All the way to the top, chasing the clouds. She climbs up, up, up, without a stop.“Maa, Baba! Hurry, please. Before the sun goes to sleep,” Meera says. Maa says, “Mmmm! I love the smell of fresh air.” Meera says, “I love the smell of flowers. And the crunching sound of fallen leaves under my feet.”Baba says, “I can also smell something I love. A cup of milky cha!” Baba sets off to chase the aroma of tea.“Can we have two cups of tea, please?” asks Baba. “And a small cup for Meera, please,” says Maa.“Right away!” says the cha wallah dada. Sssskkkk…He lights the stove with a match and places a pan of water on the fire.The water gets hotter and hotter. The tiny bubbles get bigger and bigger. The water starts boiling.Dada pours some milk into the pan with the boiling water. “Maa, see how the milk shares its colour with the water,” says Meera.“Now, see what happens when the tea leaves are added,” says Maa. Meera patiently waits for two minutes and then says in surprise, “Ooh, it is changing colour again.” “Is the tea ready now, Dada?” Meera asks.“Almost ready,” he says. Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh! He pours three cups of tea through a strainer, leaving behind little piles of sticky leaves.Finally, he adds sugar. At home, this is Meera’s job when Maa and Baba make tea. She loves the sound of the spoon tinkling against the cups. Meera stares into the cups asthe sugar disappears. “Now it is ready!” says Meera.Watch Dada make cha Can you arrange these processes in the correct order to make a cup of hot tea? Dissolution: Dada adds sugar to the tea, it mixes and disappears into the tea, making it sweet. This is when a solid breaks down, and becomes part of the liquid.Filtration: Dada pours the tea through the strainer into the cup, keeping the leaves behind. This is when bits of solid inside a liquid are removed when the liquid passes through a filter.Diffusion: The smell of tea moves from Dada’s shop to Baba’s nose through the air around them. This is when one substance mixes into another evenly. These substances move from a place that has more of them to a place that has less of them.Convection: While making tea, the hot fluid at the bottom of the pan rises to the top because it is lighter. The cooler fluid on top, sinks to the bottom and takes its place. This cycle continues and eventually heats the liquid uniformly. This is how heat flows within fluids.Conduction: Dada puts the pan on the stove, lights it up, and the pan heats up. This is when heat moves within a solid or from a solid to a liquid.	./Story text files/114.txt	2583	18	5.620938628158845	241	36	107	48.69230769230769	28	24	21	10.01923076923077	21	31	153	124	4	1.3962848297213621	301	22

"" ""What about the OnebyTwo for the jamoons? "" said Jiya.""Oh yes! I want to draw the line in the middle! "" said Rani. Rani drew a line through the sugar syrup with her spoon. But every time she moved her spoon away, the jamoons simply floated back into the centre of the bowl. ""This isn't working, didi, "" she said sadly. ""We can't do a OnebyTwo with the jamoons. "" Jiya laughed. ""Of course we can, "" she said. ""We just do it a different way. """"Let's put one here for you, "" Jiya put a jamoon in Rani's bowl, ""and one there for me. And now we do the same with the syrup. One spoonful for you, and one for me. "" ""Okay, "" said Rani. ""What next? "" ""We do it again, "" said Jiya. ""One for Rani, one for Jiya. And we keep doing that until all the jamoons and all the syrup are gone. """"Can I do it now? "" said Rani, eyes shining. ""One here, one there. And now there are no more jamoons left. OnebyTwo! """"Not so fast, "" said Jiya. ""OnebyTwo means dividing a thing into two EQUAL parts. Are you sure we have shared the jamoons equally, Rani? "" Rani shook her head. ""Let's find out, "" said Jiya. ""Count how many jamoons you have, and how many I have. "" ""I have , , . . .  jamoons, and you have , , . . .  jamoons. That means, "" Rani was excited now, ""we have shared the jamoons EQUALLY! We have a OnebyTwo! And we didn't even draw a line in the middle! "" Jiya laughed. ""Yes, you got ONE of TWO equal parts, and I got ONE of TWO equal parts. ONE by TWO! "" ""Hurray! "" said Rani. ""Can we eat now? "" They grinned at each other through a mouthful of yummy jamoons.""Did you girls have fun? "" asked Rani's Amma. ""Yes, Amma! "" Rani hugged her mother. ""I learned how to turn ONE into TWO. "" ""One into two? "" Ammi looked puzzled. ""I don't understand. "" Jiya and Rani giggled. ""That's okay, Ammi, "" winked Jiya. ""It's a secret. ""Learning to share What if Rani's friend Raju had joined Jiya and Rani? Would a OnebyTwo have worked then? No, of course it wouldn't. Jiya would have had to do a different trick, called a OnebyThree, where she divided ONE thing into THREE equal parts. What if Ammi had joined them and they still had only one plate of biryani to share? Well, Jiya would have simply performed the OnebyFour, where she would have divided the ONE plate of biryani into FOUR equal parts. There is a name in mathematics for the trick of dividing something into many equal parts. The trick is called Fractions. Fractions are wonderful because they help you share things equally and fairly. In maths: The onebytwo fraction is written as . Another name for OnebyTwo is Half. The onebythree fraction is written as . Another name for it is Onethird. The onebyfour fraction is written as . Another name for it is a Quarter.Think about it: How would you do a OnebyTwo with a dosa? Would you draw a line through the centre with a knife or use the 'one hereone there' method? What if Rafiq Kaka had given the girls seven jamoons? How would they have done a OnebyTwo then? What method would you use to do a OnebyTwo with: A bowl of sweets A glass of sugarcane juice"	./Story text files/144.txt	5369	15	5.020030816640986	560	89	130	35.04026845637584	113	36	23	7.899328859060403	95	54	332	317	4	1.269576379974326	712	67
The first house was built in a faraway land of the East, long, long ago by two friends, KindruLalim and Kincha LaliDam. In those days, people still lived in caves and did not know what a house was. One day, KindruLalim remarked, “O Lali, I’m so tired of living in a dark cave. Why don’t we build a house in the forest?” “That’s a fantastic idea, Kindru!” exclaimed Kincha LaliDam. “Let’s go and ask our friends the birds, beasts and reptiles how to build a house!”So Kincha LaliDam and KindruLalim came out of their caves and entered a dense forest. The first animal they saw was an elephant standing under a tree, flapping his large ears. “Can you tell us how to build a house, O mighty one?” they asked. The elephant trumpeted loudly and said, “Cut logs to make pillars as strong and thick as my legs!”The two friends chopped down a tree and made thick pillars out of it. A snake suddenly slithered past them on the forest floor. “Fetch poles as long and thin as I am,” hissed the snake, so off went KindruLalim and Kincha LaliDam to cut bamboos from a nearby grove.As they returned, carrying the bamboo on their backs, they heard a mournful ‘moo’. It was a mithun, a large buffalolike creature who lives in those areas and she was bending over the carcass of an animal. “Can you tell us how to build a house please?” asked Kincha LaliDam.“I’m much too sad to talk now,” said the mithun sadly, “but I’ll help you all the same. You see, a tiger has killed my husband, so make a roof with cross poles, like the bones of his skeleton,” added the mithun, pointing at her dead mate. Kincha LaliDam and KindruLalim thanked the mithun for her advice and began making cross poles out of the bamboo, but they soon began to tire.They put down the bamboo poles and walked to a nearby river to have a drink. Suddenly, a graceful fish swam up to them and whispered, “I saw from afar that you were building a house! Have a look at the scales on my back. Collect plenty of leaves and put them on the roof, one on top of the other, like my scales. That will protect your house from sun and rain,” said the fish and she gently swam away.KindruLalim and Kincha LaliDam now had all the advice they needed to build a house and they worked very hard to complete it. When it was finally done, they called the creatures of the forest to come and have a look. “What a wonderful house you’ve built!” cried everyone. “And now it’s all yours to live in!”“It’s not only ours but yours as well, because you’ve helped us build it!” cried KindruLalim and Kincha LaliDam happily. The sun shone brightly in the sky, a breeze whistled softly and the trees swayed gently as KindruLalim and Kincha Lali Dam stepped into their new house. And this is how the first house was built in that faraway land in northeastern India known today as Arunachal Pradesh!The Singphos The Singphos live in the Lohit and the Changlang districts of Arunachal Pradesh. Their tribe is divided into a number of clans each ruled by a chief known as Gam. Unlike other hill people who are involved in jhum (shifting) cultivation, the Singphos grow tea. Singpho women wear bright woollen skirts and black jackets with silver decorations during a festival called Munao Poi. The Singpho men wear colourful lungis with or without a white shirt and cover their heads with turbans. Singpho houses are usually double storied and made of wood or bamboo. They are oval in shape and the lower storey is used as a stable or for storing food while the upper storey becomes the family's living quarters.	./Story text files/5.txt	3531	16	5.867768595041323	294	69	152	79.27272727272727	12	32	30	15.545454545454545	8	36	221	142	4	1.5591939546599496	344	53
Where do my thoughts go?Do they plipplop or do they thumpthump when they walk?Do they spin and spin and spin with the fan and get didizdizzy?Do they ride on a paper plane to go play with the clouds?Do they sleep like Raasu all day long when they eat too much?Do they hide inside Mumma’s bag and secretly go to work with her?Do they tiptoe around the house looking for a treat?Do they grow up to be tomatoes if Papa plants them in the soil?Do they glow when the stars come out?But wait, I can’t find my thoughts!

One afternoon, Saboo was playing alone in the garden “Mother can I have a small puppy?” “No,” said mother. “A very small puppy?” asked Saboo. “No,” said mother.Saboo kicked a stone, which rolled near a tree. The tree trunk had fur. He touched it and looked up, up, and right up. He saw two eyes looking down at him.“Hello! Who are you?” asked a surprised Saboo. “Hello yourself, I am a giraffe. My name is Jojo. I can play with you. If you climb up on to my back, I will take you for a ride.”Saboo climbed up and away they went down the road, up the hill, and into town. Saboo shouted happily, “Jojo turn right, now left, and again right,” till they came to his friend Munni’s house.It was Munni’s birthday. The children clapped when they saw Saboo on Jojo’s back. Jojo helped Aunty put up the balloons. He was soooo. . . o tall, it was easy for him.Jojo gave the children rides, he even played kick ball with them. It was a fun party. Everyone sang, “Happy birthday to you.” Aunty put samosas, gulab jamuns, and icecreams on the table.Jojo loved the icecream, so uncle got him a bucketful of icecream. Jojo finished it all. It was time to go home. They said, “Bye Jojo, bye Saboo.” Saboo and Jojo made their way back home. Mother was standing at the gate.When she saw Saboo riding a giraffe, she was so. . . so. . . shocked. “Saboo. . . I. . . said,” “Mother you said, no small puppy, you did not say, no big tall giraffe.” Before mother could answer, the zookeeper came and took Jojo back to the zoo.	./Story text files/106.txt	1502	12	5.297142857142857	146	29	112	28.470588235294116	41	10	20	6.568627450980392	36	15	102	73	3	1.2264150943396226	200	12
The cotton farmers are worried. The harvest last year was very poor.Now it’s summer, time to sow the cotton seeds. But in their village, it’s hard to get enough local and organic seeds. “What to do? What to do?” Bijay wonders. “We have a BIG problem.”“The seeds in the market cost too much!” says Nabita. “Those seeds need pesticides and chemicals to grow,” says Ketaki. “We want seeds that grow happily here, seeds that are best for our home soil and weather,” says Bijay.“What to do? What to do?” says Suresh. “We have a BIG problem.”Nabita and Ketaki are part of a group of women farmers. They hold meetings. They meet the village head. They talk to farmers’ groups.“What to do? What to do?” everyone wonders. “We have a BIG problem!”After many days of talking, everyone looks happy. “We know what to do,” says Nabita. “No problem is too BIG. We will start a bank!” “How will a bank help us?” asks Bijay. “Not a bank of money. A bank of seeds,” says Ketaki.The farmers come together to start a seed bank. They deposit the few seeds they have at home.A seed bank works just like a bank! People go to a bank to save their money. At the seed bank, farmers save seeds!Old seeds Local seeds Organic seeds Cotton seeds Ladies’ fingers seeds Pumpkin seeds Paddy seeds Millet seeds Red gram seeds So many seeds to save.Sumati borrows one kilo of cotton seeds from the bank. Nabita carefully notes it down in a register. Krupa deposits one kilo of paddy seeds into the bank. Ketaki carefully stores the seeds in a pot.The seeds are sown and watered. The monsoon comes and goes.It’s harvest time!The farmers get a good crop of cotton this year. They celebrate with their friends.Sumati gains more cotton seeds from the harvest. She repays her seed loan with interest, by depositing oneand ahalf kilos of cotton seeds into the bank. Ketaki carefully notes this down in the register. Nabita carefully stores the seeds in the pot.The seed bank now has lots and lots of seeds. Seeds for the next year. Seeds for the year after that. And the year after that! The cotton farmers no longer have a BIG problem. Because their seed bank is VERY BIG! The seeds are everywhere, in the bank and in the field!The Seed Bankers We need seeds to grow food and fibre for clothes. But seeds can cost a lot. Some seeds, called hybrid seeds, cannot be replanted after the harvest and have to be thrown away. Some seeds need chemicals to grow. These are genetically modified seeds. Then there are seeds that may be from another part of the world and not suited to the soil of your region.By saving local and organic seeds that do not need chemicals to grow, farmers don’t need to buy seeds from the market. Just like a regular bank, they can deposit seeds. They can borrow them, and repay the loan with extra seeds!This story has been inspired by Maa Lankeshwari Seed Bank in Bhimdanga village in Odisha in India. A group called Chetna Organic helped farmers start a seed bank to save their cotton and other seeds.Many farmers in India and around the world have come together to form seed banks to save seeds. Often, women run seed banks. They are called Seed Bankers or Seed Guardians, because they protect seeds.There is also a bank for the world’s seeds in the cold and remote Arctic region. It’s called the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. Here, you can find over , ,  kinds of seeds from all over the world.	./Story text files/421.txt	3378	15	5.643243243243243	313	57	146	43.46052631578947	56	20	25	8.973684210526315	44	32	229	141	5	1.394859813084112	379	49
"One day, the great Buddha was taking a walk around the monastery. He was approached by a monk who wanted a new woolen shawl.The Buddha asked him, ""What has happened to your old shawl? "" ""It had become very old and worn out. So I am using it as a bedsheet, "" replied the monk.The Buddha asked again, ""But what happened to your old bedsheet? "" ""Master, that bed sheet got old with use. It was worn and torn. So I cut it up and made a pillow cover out of it, "" replied the monk.""But there certainly was a pillow cover before you made a new one. What did you do to your old pillow cover? "" asked the Buddha. ""My head had rubbed a million times against the old pillow cover and had made a big hole in it. So I made a doormat out of it, "" replied the monk, in earnest.Gautama Buddha was not satisfied by this answer. He always delved deep into every issue. He asked the monk, ""Tell me, what did you do with your old doormat? ""The monk replied with folded hands, ""Master, the old doormat had got totally worn out. After being used for so long, the warp and the weft had come out. So I took the cotton fibres and braided a wick out of them. Later, I burned the cotton wick in the oil lamp. "" The Buddha smiled after listening to the monk. The monk got a new shawl!Make your own cloth ball . Choose old clothes at home that you can reuse.

"Once long ago, the birds had a meeting. They wanted a king, just like people and animals. Which bird should be king?""The Eagle, he is strong and kingly! "" said one. ""No, he has no crown, and when he calls, he sounds too sad, "" said another. ""Then Ostrich, because he is the largest and roars like a lion, "" one called out. ""No, he can't fly. The king of the birds must be able to fly. """"I think I should be king, "" said Peacock, fanning his tail. ""I am so beautiful. "" ""You are too proud, "" said Owl. ""I have the largest eyes of any bird. I should be king. "" ""No, not you, Owl, "" they shouted. ""You go to sleep when the sun rises. ""And so they didn’t get very far. Then one bird had an idea. “He who can fly the highest will be king,” he said. “Yes, yes,” they shouted, and they all flew up, up, into the sky.The Goose flew for one day, straight over the highest mountains in the world. The Eagle flew for two days into the blue above the mountains. But the Vulture soared for three whole days without stopping, straight toward the sun.Way above them, the birds heard Vulture cry, ""I am the highest, I am king! ""But then just above him Vulture heard a tiny voice, ""Tink, tink, tink! I am the highest, I am king. "" It was Ncede, the Neddicky, the smallest bird of all! He had held onto the great wing feathers of Vulture as he soared into the sky!""You won’t beat me again, "" said Vulture, and soared straight up into the air. He flew up and up until he could fly no more. ""I am higher than any other bird. I am your king! "" he cried.But out from under his wing crept the tiny bird. ""Tink, tink! Tink, tink! It is I, the smallest one! I am your king. "" Vulture was too exhausted to fly any further.So down he sailed  with the little bird still under his wing. The other birds were furious with Ncede. They waited for him, ready to pluck out all his feathers.But the quick little bird saw how angry they were, and flew into an empty snake hole.""With your big eyes, you must keep guard at the hole and catch him when he comes out, "" they said to Owl. So Owl sat in front of the hole.But the sun was warm and soon Owl was fast asleep. The little bird peeped out, saw that Owl was asleep, and zzip, away he went.Owl was very ashamed that he had let the little bird escape. Now he only hunts at night. In the day, he sleeps, away from the sight of the other birds."	./Story text files/501.txt	2357	12	4.988142292490118	223	30	104	45.23529411764706	31	20	23	10.156862745098039	20	31	165	88	3	1.1016949152542372	288	7
Kallu stood frowning up at a huge poster stuck on the wall of the school compound. “Madan Murari Dev Maharaj is here!” he read out aloud. “Astrologer, master of horoscopes, tantra expert…” He turned to his best friend Damu who was standing beside him and asked, “What’s a kundalini?”“I’m not too sure…” Damu scratched his ear, “something that goes up and down the spine…” “And what does that do?” “Generates some sort of electricity.” “Kya baat! He could solve our powercut problem then,” Kallu grinned. “Right! We’ll all use the kundalini to start the water pump in the fields,” Damu laughed. By then, they had been joined by Kallu’s younger brother Shabbo. “Madan Murari Dev Maharaj,” he read the big letters under the picture of a fat man with a beard and a bright red turban. “Long name!” “Of course he has a long name,” Damu replied. “Look at all the things he can do – astrology, horoscopes, numbers, face reading, palmistry…”As they walked away, Shabbo who had got four out of ten in the last maths test, asked thoughtfully, “Do you think he could predict the questions in tomorrow’s class test?”Soon the news of the astrologer had spread across Khajuria village. According to Damu’s grandmother Moti Dadi, Murari Dev had to just look into your eyes and say a mantra and he instantly knew everything about you – your past, present, future were all transferred to his mind like magic.“You mean now he knows that you borrowed a shawl from Billo Chachi and never returned it?” Damu’s sister Saru asked with a grin. “Don’t be silly, that is not important!” Moti Dadi waved a dismissive hand. “It is important to Billo Chachi,” Saru’s friend Munia commented and that made Moti Dadi so angry that she shooed both the girls out of her room. So Kallu and his gang decided it was time to check out ‘Madan Murari Dev Maharaj, World Renowned Astrologer– Palmist–Tantra Expert–Futurologist– Numerologist. ’ The gang included Kallu and Damu who were both in class nine.Saru and Munia were in class eight and Shabbo who was the youngest was in the seventh. In the school register, Kallu was Kallan, Damu was Damodar, Munia was Munira, Saru was Saraswati and Shabbo was Shabbir, but even their school principal, Masterji often forgot their real names.The gang headed out the same evening. The astrologer was a guest at the home of Raghu Singh, the village sarpanch, and on the way to his house, they had to go past the Hanuman temple and there they saw a very strange sight. The temple priest Lattu Mishra was sitting hunched up outside, his chin resting on his knees, looking sadly out into space. Lattu was usually a cheerful man who greeted people with a smile. Masterji had chosen him to play Bharat in the village Ramleela because of his kind face and gentle smile. “Lattu Bhaiya,” Munia ran up and asked anxiously, “what’s the matter? Are you ill?” Lattu shook his head gloomily and then nodded to the temple behind him, “See the temple? It’s Tuesday and it is empty.”They looked at the deserted temple in surprise. Usually on Tuesdays, people would stream in all day. It would echo with the chanting of mantras and the ringing of bells and Lattu would be busy before the altar, doing puja and arti to Hanumanji. “To Raghu Singh’s house, where else? Since the day that astrologer fellow has started his business, no one has time for Hanumanji anymore.” “Have you seen him?” “Of course I have! I know everything about him. He used to have a mithai shop in town at one time and his name was Murari Lal. Everyone called him Mota Murari because he was so fat. Then suddenly he grew a beard and became this MadanwhateverMaharaj. He’s just learnt some magic tricks and is fooling the whole village.”“I’d read in the papers,” Kallan said thoughtfully, “about this school for magicians in Kerala. The principal of the school said that half his students were fake astrologers and sadhus.” “Maybe he went there.” Then Lattu noticed that they were all wearing their good clothes and looking very neat and clean. “You all are also going there?” he asked sadly. “Just for a look, Lattu Bhaiya,” Saru said gently. “We’ll be back soon.” When they strolled up to Raghu Singh’s house, they discovered that a huge tent had been put up in front and behind it, a smaller tent that had a kitchen where two cooks were busy over a large karhai that was smoking over a fire. Damu zipped off for a quick look and came back with a happy gleam in his eyes.Peering in, they discovered that the main tent was packed with people. They squeezed in at the back and looked around; it looked like the whole village was present.There was Dharampal Chacha, the chai shop owner who played Ram in the Ramleela and his pretty wife Billo Chachi. Kishan Prasad, the grocer was chatting with Masterji who was offering him a paan. Even Mangu Mali, the mango orchard owner was sitting in a corner giving everyone his sour smile. Badri, the mad buffalo man who was sitting right in front of them turned, gave a grin — his huge yellow teeth gleaming behind his bushy moustache  and asked, “Did you check the kitchen at the back?”“Of course I did,” Damu gave a superior smile. He never missed out on important matters like food. “They are making halwa and puri, with asli ghee!” “Aha ha ha!” Badri rolled his eyes in ecstasy.“Raghu Singh is a fool,” Mangu Mali said grimly, “feeding everyone and wasting money like this.” A sort of stage had been built in front with folding tables. A very tall, thin man was busy covering it with a mattress and a white sheet and then he placed a couple of bolsters on top. He lit a bunch of incense sticks and waved them about in the air.“Who’s that?” Munia wanted to know. “That is Paltan Pandey,” Shabbo said, as the thin man began fixing a mike. “I asked him and he told me that he was the Maharaj’s number one assistant.” “Where is number two?” Kallu looked around. “I don’t think there is one,” Damu laughed. Kallu wondered if people planned to spend their hard earned money to get their horoscopes read or, like his gang, were only there for the ‘asligheehalwapuri prasad’ treat.Madan Murari Dev Maharaj was late and everyone was getting restless. Heads kept turning to the opening in the tent to see if he was coming. A couple of babies began to bawl, then Moti Dadi had a coughing fit and Saru had to go out and get her a glass of water.Billo Chachi had come prepared to wait and had nearly finished knitting the sleeve of a sweater. Noticing the growing restlessness, Paltan Pandey suddenly sat down with a harmonium and began to sing a bhajan in a flat, tuneless moan. Everyone was falling into a bored trance when to their surprise, Paltan suddenly shot up his arms in the air and yelled “Jai Murari Dev!” making everyone jump.It seemed the audience was expected to join in and they did. At least it was something to do. So everyone waved their arms and echoed his call, “Jai Murari Dev!” The gang grinned at each other and joined in, yelling at the top of their voices, “Jai Kapil Dev! Jai Kapil Dev!” but after they had called for their cricket hero Kapil the third time, some of the elders turned and glared at them and they decided to shut up. Too much of the funny stuff could get them kicked out of the tent and as Damu pointed out, halwapuri was at stake. As if finally hearing their calls, Murari Dev arrived, leaning on the arm of Raghu Singh and walking very, very slowly. “Baap re!” an astonished Saru whispered. “He’s really fat!” “That photo on the poster must have been taken years ago.”Murari Dev was quite short and wearing a bright red flowing silk robe, and rows and rows of multicoloured beads were hanging around his neck. His long, grey beard flowed down over his generous potbelly and he was quite bald. There was a red tikka drawn on his forehead and even though it was evening, to everyone’s surprise he wore a jazzy pair of dark glasses.“Dark glasses?” Damu looked around, “where’s the sun?” Murari Dev went past them and they were swept away by the strong scent of his cologne. “Kya baat!” Kallu commented happily. “Dark glasses, bead necklaces, perfume, this is a hero horoscope man! Straight from Bollywood!” Munia was still staring at Paltan with a thoughtful frown, “Paltan looks familiar somehow.” “I know,” Shabbo grinned, “in a safari suit, he’d look just like Ram Lochan at the petrol pump.” “Correct!” they all said together. Badri turned to glare at them, “Chup!” So they shut up but Munia and Saru had to try really hard to stop the giggles. They never knew astrology could be so funny! By then Murari Dev was sitting leaning against a bolster, panting slightly and wiping his face with a handkerchief.Paltan rushed up with a glass of water. Raghu Singh switched on a table fan. Murari Dev cleared his throat, checked his watch and pulled the mike closer. “Please start,” Damu muttered, “the halwa is getting cold.” With majestic slowness, Murari Dev stood up, walked to the edge of the stage and with a dramatic flourish, waved his podgy hands in the air.Suddenly walnuts and raisins were raining on the audience! Behind the astrologer, Paltan was banging away at the harmonium and swaying to the tune. Murari Dev waved his arms again and more raisins and walnuts flew around.“They’re real!” Saru mumbled, busy chewing. “Must have got them from Kishen Prasad’s grocery store,” Damu said as he scrambled about for more. The gang sat up. It looked like the introduction was over and the show was about to begin. Paltan announced on the mike that Murari Dev would now predict the future and read minds. He then walked around in the audience with chits of paper. Someone would write a number on a chit, which would be sealed inside an envelope and carried to the astrologer, who would touch the envelope, hum a mantra and then recite the number correctly.Very impressed by the mind reading, people were soon trooping up on stage to know about their futures and many of them were carrying their horoscopes. Murari Dev talked to them in a low voice and then whispered his predictions into their ears. So the gang could not hear anything . The rupee notes were soon piling up in the brass plate kept before him. Finally the show was over and everyone got their leaf plate of halwapuri. To the background music of the harmonium, Murari Dev got up and swayed across the stage. Then with a piercing yell and a splintering crash, Murari Dev vanished!There was pandemonium in the pandal. Paltan and Raghu Singh were frantically searching for him. Moti Dadi was weeping loudly and calling out, “Maharaj aap kahan ho?” Masterji was yelling at the gang, ordering them to go and find a torch. And in the middle of all the chaos, Badri and Mangu Mali stood there, laughing their heads off.Then to everyone’s relief, Murari Dev slowly crawled out from under the stage and as Paltan and Raghu Singh rushed up to help him, he stood up groggily. He was quite a sight, his snazzy glasses askew, his beard covered in spider’s web and his silk robe all dusty. “What happened?” Damu asked puzzled. “I thought it was a vanishing act,” Kallu said. It took a while to solve the mystery. The stage had been made with three wooden folding tables and one of them had a broken leg. When fat Murari Dev had stepped on it, the table had collapsed taking him down with it. He now sat panting on a chair, flushed, dishevelled and obviously feeling very sorry for himself.At this crucial moment, Saru spoke up. Planting herself in front of the astrologer, she bent a stern face towards him and said clearly above the hubbub, “But Murari Devji. . . I don’t understand this!” The fat astrologer sat up and stared at her. “You could read the numbers, pick walnuts out of the air and predict futures. How is it that you didn’t know that the table was broken?” In the growing silence, Murari Dev glared at Saru and her gang who were standing there looking critically at him. Then with a grim look on his face, he got up and stalked out of the pandal, as everyone began to laugh. Moti Dadi laughed so hard that she had another coughing fit and everyone agreed it had been a really great show.	./Story text files/148.txt	12084	21	5.923076923076923	996	252	263	71.8012048192771	63	103	46	13.94578313253012	54	112	619	629	8	1.609261939218524	1183	199
ALL TYPES OF AIRCRAFT This Book Belongs to __________________________________________________An aircraft is a craft that flies through the air. There are many different types of aircraft.An aeroplane is a type of aircraft, that has fixed wings for lift, and a means of propulsion.  Means of Propulsion is a fancy way to say  a way to move on its own. There are big aeroplanes, and small aeroplanes,There are VERY big aeroplanes, and very small aeroplanes,Some aeroplanes have jet engines, and some have propellers. sA glider is an aircraft which flies without a motor, it uses air currents for lift.A glider needs to be launched, by towing or by a winch, A motor glider uses a motor to launch, then stows the motor after takeoffA helicopter is an aircraft that uses rotating blades like wings to create lift.A helicopter can also have a piston engine,or a jet engine.A hot air balloon is an aircraft which is lighter that air. It's just like a party helium balloon, floating into the air when you let go.And, just like a party helium balloon, They come in all sorts of different shapes and sizesThe balloon pilot lets the gas cool to come down, and heats it up to rise.Airships are like balloons, filled with gasses lighter than air. This enables the airship to float into the air like a balloon.But, unlike a balloon, they also have a means of steering and propulsion. Airships are also sometimes called 'zeppelins' or 'blimps'Because of their complex design, and a poor accident history during their early years, there are only a few airships still in operation today. The last flight of the HindenburgSome aircraft are built to do a special job.Aerobatic aircraft Like aerobatic aeroplanes, are built for doing aerobatic flying, for displays, competitions, or joy rides.Military aircraft, work to defend the people and the country they belong to.Agricultural aircraft help farmers with their job.There are aircraft that help to save peoples lives;Working as firefighters, air ambulances, and in search and rescue.Which aircraft do you want to fly?Draw a picture of your favourite aircraft here.Write about your favourite aircraft here.

Baby Thangwang likes to talk. GAA! GEE! GLUG GLUG, he says. Bhalluka, the brown bear likes to talk too. GRRRR. GROOOOOWWWW. KHURRR. Baby Thangwang and Bhalluka the bear like to talk to each other.One day, Thangwang lost his little red toy. He began to cry.Don’t cry please, said Bhalluka! HA HOO, HOOHA! GRRGROO! Bhalluka’s tummy went in and out when he talked. Thangwang looked at the tummy and tapped it – TAPTAPTAP. TAPP! THUPP!That made Bhalluka burp. Loudly! BURP BURPPPPPP!

In India, there are three kinds of bears  The Himalayan Black Bear, The Brown Bear and The Sloth Bear. The bear in this book looks like a brown bear. Bears like fresh growing shoots of grass. They also like fruits like apples, peaches and mulberries. Though brown bears do kill goats and other animals, they usually do not attack human beings. During winter in cold places, bears in the wild do not get enough to eat. What do they do then? They just go to sleep for a very long time! This long sleep is called hibernation. They can sleep without eating, drinking or  even going to the bathroom  for more than  days!	./Story text files/507.txt	1563	12	5.7398843930635834	138	35	102	33.0	34	12	21	7.065217391304348	30	16	99	74	4	1.1272727272727272	205	15
Like ballet dancers they pirouette on one leg, raising graceful shimmering pink wings… a cloud of pink on a blue lake. Flamingos are the ‘beauty queens’ of the bird world.The word ‘flamingo’ comes from the Spanish word ‘flamenco’ which means fire. It refers to the bright colour of the flamingo’s feathers. Flamenco is also the name of a famous dance from Spain, a country in Europe. Some people believe that the flamenco dance was so named as the dancers imitated the movements of the flamingo. Pirouette: a fast turn using the tip or heel of the feet Shimmering: shiningWhen you think of flamingos, you always remember their beautiful pink colour. Amazingly, the birds get this colour from the food they eat! Flamingos eat organisms such as plankton, shrimps, crabs and tiny water plants. All of these have special colouring agents which cause a flamingo to turn pink when it eats them.If you take a flamingo away from its natural habitat and don’t feed it these kinds of food, their colour will turn whiter and whiter as days pass by. Flamingos are water birds – they live and feed near the sea coast and lakes as the food they eat is found in water. They are quite tall – some of them can grow up to a height of .  metres. That is almost as tall as a human!These birds have very long legs so they can walk far into the water. Although most photos will show you pictures of flamingos wading in the shallow water, these birds can also swim! Like other water birds such as ducks, flamingos have webbed feet. Webbed feet help birds push water back and swim across a water bodyThey are also powerful fliers and can fly at speeds of more than  kilometres an hour – that’s the speed at which cars move on roads.They can travel over long distances and even cover the distance of nearly  kilometres at one time – that’s more than the distance between Delhi and Lucknow!Watching a flock take off is an amazing sight – like an airplane, they need to pick up speed by running before they can lift off. They run, flapping their wings before gracefully lifting off into the sky.What makes the flamingo stand out? Other than its pink colour, one of the things that make the flamingo so different from other birds is its long, long neck! The flamingo’s neck is made up of  bones! The long neck is extremely useful in helping the flamingo fish for its food – it’s almost like having an extra long fishing rod.The lifespan of a bird is connected to its size – the bigger it is, the longer it lives. Given how big they are, it is not surprising that flamingos live quite long. Flamingos usually live for  years. The Greater Flamingo lives the longest, up to  years. Among birds, flamingos have one of the longest lifespans. Lifespan: The number of years for which a person or animal usually livesThere are just six kinds of flamingos in all, but they are found all over the world, from North and South America to Europe, Africa and Asia. Did you know? that the most endangered species of flamingo is the Andean flamingo – less than ,  of these birds are left in the world. Endangered: In danger of becoming extinct, when not even one of a certain kind of animal is left in the worldIn India, flamingos are found in many places across the country. Large numbers are seen in states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. In India we see two kinds of flamingos – the Greater Flamingo and the Lesser Flamingo. As you may have guessed, the Greater Flamingo is bigger than its shorter cousin, the Lesser Flamingo.Flamingos are often found in huge flocks of thousands of birds that look like carpets of pink flowers scattered over the surface of blue lakes and water bodies. The largest flocks of flamingos are found in the lakes of East Africa – here, sometimes, more than a million gather at a time.Did you know?  that the flamingo is the state bird of Gujarat. They are found in groups of thousands in the state.  a group of flamingos is called a flock or a colony. Flamingos like to live in large groups as they feel safer that way. When these birds hunt for food, they spend a lot of time with their heads in the water. So, it is useful to be part of a big group where there’s always someone to alert you of danger nearby.This is a photograph of a flock of Lesser Famingos taken at Lake Bogoria in East Africa. Lake Bogoria is a very unique kind of water body called a ‘soda’ lake. The water in soda lakes has a huge quantity of different kinds of salts mixed in it. This keeps away many animals that need freshwater with less salt to drink – but for the flamingo, these soda lakes are like a fivestar restaurant!That’s because, in these saltrich lakes, a variety of plants grow in huge numbers. These plants are the favourite food of flamingos. With no other competition for this food, flamingos flock to these lakes to eat the plants. The water of the soda lakes is almost like an ‘alkali’ – most animals also keep away as stepping into the water could burn their skin! Flamingos are one of the few kinds of animals that can safely step into a soda lake. No wonder they feel very safe here – when danger threatens, they can simply step deeper into the water.Did you know? that the flamingo eats with its head upside down.One of the most unusual things about the flamingo is the way it eats  First the flamingo mixes up the water and mud nearby using its feet and beak.  It then dips its beak down and sometimes puts its entire head under water and scoops up a cup full of muddy water in its beak.  The upsidedown beak is then used like a sieve (like the steel strainer used to drain out tea leaves when making chai). Water drips out of the beak, leaving behind tiny plants and animals for the bird to munch on.When it is time to start a family, flamingos start ‘putting on makeup’ in order to make themselves look attractive to a partner. Of course, they don’t reach out for powder and lipstick. Instead, they spread the oil produced by a gland (a kind of body part) near their tails over their feathers, turning them a brighter pink. Unlike other birds, flamingos do not lay eggs every year – they do so only when it rains. Rain gives them materials to build their nest. Rainwater ponds and lakes are home to tiny water creatures that are the flamingo’s food. So rainfall is very important to mama birds and the always hungry chicks. Since flamingos live in large colonies, depending on the rainfall, either the whole colony will be full of chicks, or there won’t be any young bird at all.Before the eggs can be laid, the nest has to be built. Unlike birds that build nests made of twigs on trees, flamingos build their nests on the ground. They use sticks, stones and mud to create a mound that looks like a little volcano on the ground. The design of the nest is very clever really – the top of the mound dips like a saucer, so that the egg does not roll away.Flamingo eggs can be quite big. So a female bird mostly lays only one egg. For almost a month, the parent birds take turns to keep the egg warm, by sitting on it. This is called incubation. At the end of this long wait, a young chick hatches out. Surprise, surprise! The chick is not pink or red like its parents but grey and white. Young flamingos take three years to take on the pinkred colour.The real work for papa and mama begins after the young one hatches out of the egg. For a week or two, the baby bird stays in the nest and is fed a kind of milk that the parents make in their own bodies. Then, the parents teach it to hunt for water creatures and the baby bird becomes more independent. You would have heard of crèches – a play school where parents who need to go out to work leave their kids during the day. You may have been to a crèche when much younger. Believe it or not, flamingo colonies also operate their own crèches. A group of adults takes care of large groups of young ones. Some crèches can have thousands of birds! Parents visit the crèches to feed their own young ones. Were you wondering how parents recognise their babies in such big groups? Well, it’s through their voice.Flamingos are noisy birds and talk a lot to each other by making grunting, honking (like a car horn) and even growling sounds. It’s by calling out to each other that flocks stay together. Flamingos are water birds – so what is their role in this environment? These birds eat algae and small organisms in water bodies and thus prevent a wetland from becoming choked with algae.These birds are very popular with tourists who visit many areas of the world just to see them. Many people earn a living from these tourists by operating hotels, restaurants and driving around visitors. So, flamingos help people earn a living in these areas.So, does this beautiful bird have natural enemies or predators? Because of where they live, in soda lakes and water bodies that have high alkali content, flamingos are generally well protected. Young birds may sometimes be hunted by eagles, hyenas and jackals. But one of the biggest threats to these birds is us, humans. We don’t hunt them for meat, but by building roads, farms, factories and towns near their habitats, we disturb the colonies and force them out of their homes. This may affect the number of young ones born in a colony as flamingos may find it difficult to find other habitats that are as well suited to them. The sight of these delicate, pretty birds that look like living lotuses on water, is one of the most wonderful visions in the natural world. Let’s make sure that this is one vision that doesn’t fade away but continues to be enjoyed in the years to come.Anita Mani: This book is ‘for Maitreya, who opened my eyes skyward to the beauty of birds. ’	./Story text files/242.txt	9683	18	5.736363636363636	797	193	213	86.24324324324324	20	91	40	17.00900900900901	12	99	621	369	4	1.5344986200551978	907	180
Once a week, Nani* goes to the park. Today, Venki wants to go with her. “I walk slowly,” says Nani. “And I take my time getting there.” “I don’t mind,” says Venki. So Nani picks up her shopping bag and starts to cross the road. “But Nani,” says Venki, “the park is that way!” *Nani means grandmother.“We’ll go this way,” says Nani, “through the Lane of Treasures.”The Lane of Treasures? What a wonderful name for the market. The shops here sell everything! When Nani finishes shopping, Venki points to a gate and asks, “Shall we take a shortcut, Nani? We’ll be at the park in no time.”“No,” says Nani. “We’ll go through the Lane of Beauty.”In the Lane of Beauty, the people stitch amazing goddhis. * A lady gives Nani a goddhi in which Venki sees a piece of her favourite saree and a bit of his Ma’s kurta. “Shall we go to the park now?” asks Venki. *A goddhi (pronounced gothedee) is a traditional handstitched quilt made of recycled material, usually soft, old cotton sarees.“Yes,” says Nani. “We’ll take the Lane of Happiness.”“Come, come,” Nani calls softly and Venki laughs as dogs and cats tumble out from everywhere!Nani pours the milk she bought at the market and they watch as the animals lick their bowls clean. Venki doesn’t want to leave the Lane of Happiness but Nani reminds him that they are on their way to the park. Next, Nani and Venki walk through a lane behind a little school.The children are playing langdi, lagori and sakhli. * “Is this the Lane of Noise?” asks Venki. “No, it’s the Lane of Mischief. It reminds me of you and your friends!” laughs Nani. “Have you named all the lanes in the city?” asks Venki. “Not all,” smiles Nani, “only the ones that are important to me!” *These are some traditional games played in India.“The park is not far now, but you will have to be a little patient. I want to stop at the Lane of Friendship.”In the Lane of Friendship, Nani visits her dear friend. They were girls together and they have grown old together. They whisper and they giggle.Then, Nani gives her friend a hug and says, “It is time to leave. We will now walk through the Lane of Dreams.”The Lane of Dreams has more books than Venki’s school library! The bookseller sells old books for very little money and buys the ones people have finished reading.Nani chooses a book and says, “Let’s go, we are almost at the park now.” And they walk down the Lane of Magic.Venki looks up at the big trees that offer shade, and feels a cool breeze. Nani shows him Gulmohar, Amaltas and Jarul trees.The flowers on the road look like a magic carpet.At last they are at the park. It has been a long time since they left home. Venki looks around and thinks of all the people and places he has seen that morning.“I like your lanes, Nani,” he says. “May I come with you next week too?”	./Story text files/550.txt	2792	18	5.6655629139072845	254	48	127	48.0	35	22	25	9.912280701754385	25	32	176	126	4	1.3610315186246418	320	29
My village had many problems. We made a long line to fetch water from one tap.We waited for food donated by others.We locked our houses early because of thieves.Many children dropped out of school.Young girls worked as maids in other villages.Young boys roamed around the village while others worked on people's farms.When the wind blew, waste paper hung on trees and fences.People were cut by broken glass that was thrown carelessly.Then one day, the tap dried up and our containers were empty.My father walked from house to house asking people to attend a village meeting.People gathered under a big tree and listened.My father stood up and said, “We need to work together to solve our problems.”Eightyearold Juma, sitting on a tree trunk shouted, “I can help with cleaning up.”One woman said, “The women can join me to grow food.”Another man stood up and said, “The men will dig a well.”We all shouted with one voice, “We must change our lives.” From that day we worked together to solve our problems.	./Story text files/30.txt	1004	22	6.12962962962963	85	23	81	51.89473684210526	8	11	15	9.894736842105264	7	12	79	29	4	1.5210084033613445	109	10
Simba was now nine months old. And he had decided it was time for him to be a real watch dog. He would stay awake all night and guard his family. But then he needed to sleep during the day. Where could he sleep without being disturbed?His first thought was the kitchen. Mother was tolerant and she whipped wonderful smells. But the thought of the shrill pressure cooker, the grinding of teeth of the mixer and the sputtering of mustard seeds who could sleep through these sounds?Father’s room was out of the question Father was strict about rules and he kept the door to his room shut. Father did not trust Simba!One day he slipped into the laundry basket it was wonderful. Full of the smells of his family. He secretly wondered why humans shed their skin so quickly, every day practically. But Bina, the maid upset his cosy plans when she picked up the basket and upended the contents on to the floor.His attempts to sleep peacefully were all in vain. How could a house of four members, of whom two left every morning, be so noisy and unsafe for a poor dog? The drawing room was frequently disturbed by the calling bell; the bathroom was no place for a decent dog. And the bedrooms were not kept open for Simba.A week after this futile search for a cosy corner, Mother kept calling Simba. She couldn’t find him anywhere. He had not gone out, so where could he be? It was only by midmorning she realized where the cunning little pup was. He was curled up on an old, empty sack, in a corner of the storeroom!Mother gently closed the store room door, remembering to leave it a little ajar for the poor tired mite who took his guard duties so seriously.	./Story text files/485.txt	1650	16	6.0	124	32	155	65.04	11	14	28	13.08	7	18	95	61	4	1.502857142857143	152	23
"Satya can’t stay still. He runs and jumps and spins and rolls. . . . . . and falls!""Sit quietly for a minute! "" says Appa. ""If you get hurt, don’t come crying to me, "" says Akka.""Don’t you dare break anything! "" says Thaatha. ""You're disturbing the class, "" says his teacher.But what can Satya do if his hands and legs are always dancing?Today is Sunday. It’s Satya’s favourite day of the week — the day he goes to the farm where Amma works.It’s a long walk to the farm, through secret upanddown paths, open fields, thick forests and gently flowing streams.Satya hops like a hare and sprints like a deer. ""The mud is squishy. Be careful! "" says Amma.He crawls like a centipede and slithers like a snake. ""Look out for thorns! "" says Amma.He swings like a spider and leaps like a langur. ""Wheeeee! "" ""Use the strong branches, my little monkey, "" says Amma.He paddles like a duck and swims like a frog. ""Stay in the shallows, okay? "" says Amma.He climbs like a lizard and jumps like a goat. ""Don’t slip! "" says Amma.Satya flaps his arms like wings and tries to fly away. He imagines himself soaring and gliding like a vulture.Late in the evening, when the sun sets and crickets begin to hum, it’s time to go home. Tired Satya climbs on to his mother's back. They return through the upanddown paths, fields, forests and streams.At home, Appa, Akka and Thaatha take one look at bruised and muddy Satya, and burst into laughter.Thaatha bathes him. Appa cooks him dinner. Akka tells him his favourite story as he falls asleep.In his dreams, Satya runs and jumps and spins and rolls. . .. . . and flies away!How do they move? Oh, the way Satya moves! Did you know that animals, birds and insects also move in many different ways and for different reasons? Like us, they move mainly to find delicious food, a cozy home and a warm family. Some of them also move to escape from being caught and eaten by other animals. Find out how some of these creatures move!Dolphins are famous for how they leap out of water. Can you leap? Cheetahs are the fastest land animals. They can run really fast and sprint too, especially when they hunt. Can you sprint?Crabs can walk sideways. Can you walk sideways? Grasshoppers can jump really high, especially when they want to escape from being eaten. Can you jump really high? Snails crawl. Slowly. Very, very slowly. Can you crawl slowly?"	./Story text files/313.txt	2364	16	5.456521739130435	230	46	115	32.785714285714285	51	19	19	7.085714285714285	43	27	169	107	4	1.2321428571428572	313	23
I can see big, black clouds in the sky and I can hear BADABOOM, the roll of thunder. The monsoon is here. It is called Varsha Ritu in Sanskrit. I love the smell of wet earth. After a long hot summer, the soil also loves the first raindrops I think.The rain makes beautiful patterns on the ground. My uncle has kept big drums in some places to save rain water. The rain water from the terrace comes and falls into these drums. So I call them waterfalls!Aunty likes to sing aloud when it starts raining. Shubha aunty who lives in Varanasi, taught me some lovely songs called ‘Kajari’. Do you know, Miyan Tansen, a very famous singer in the court of Emperor Akbar, could bring the rain down from the skies just by singing a song in raag ‘Miyan ki Malhar! ' I am going to start learning Indian classical music too.I got wet in the rain when I came running back from school, but it was fun. I saw peacocks dancing in the fields near our house. They never seem to get wet! I cannot wait to sit on the swing that Manu has put up on the big tree, and feel the cool rainy breeze on my face.I can smell the pakodas being fried in the kitchen. Can I be greedy and eat some corn too? Amma makes us drink hot milk. Yesterday, she had made spicy puffed rice. And tomorrow, she says she will make puris!All the trees and plants will look green and happy. Just like the green dupatta that Hari bhaiya sent for me from Jaipur. He said it is called a ‘dhaani chunariya. ’ ‘Dhaani’ means the fresh green colour of paddy saplings. Grandpa told me that good rain means the farmers will get a good crop. We all wait for the rains, but farmers worship the rain gods.My mango tree has grown very tall during the monsoon season. I do not have to water it at all! And when the wind blew hard last month, my tree stood firm. When will my mango tree be as big as this one?	./Story text files/555.txt	1844	16	5.292079207920792	181	21	168	54.90909090909091	15	18	34	11.787878787878787	9	24	141	61	4	1.2977777777777777	212	13
Kicchu woke up early one morning. “It is time to catch some fish,” he said yawning.He met Choru on the way to the pond. They were best friends who played all day long.Munia saw them marching with their fishing rods. “We are going to the pond to catch fish. Come along Munia, if you wish.”Little Munia thought for sometime. “Please don’t do that,” she said, “without water, the fish will die.”They did not listen to what Munia had to say. They headed to the pond straight away.Kicchu and Choru sat waiting by the pond. Two fish swam across, one thin and another round.Then came the third fish, the biggest one they had seen. Munia said laughing, “It is bigger than Appa’s feet!”Kicchu and Choru held on tight to their rods. Kicchu screamed, “MY FISH!” Choru also screamed, “NO. . . MY FISH!”Kicchu pulled hard. . . Choru pulled harder. . .PHAAATTT! Both the rods broke. THUDDD! Kicchu fell to the ground. SSSPPLAASH! Choru fell into the water.What had happened? What do you think?

This is Bekku. And that is me in the mirror.This is what I love to do . . . and this is what Bekku likes to do.This is Bekku's favorite place, and that is mine. When Bekku sees a mouse she runs after it.But if I see a mouse, I run from it.Then when I run after my beeping car, Bekku scoots out through the door ajar.When mamma gives us milk, we both go SLURP, SLURP.

You wanted to play first. ""We returned home without salt or cooking oil. We were very dirty and worried.Grandmother was annoyed when we got home.

The older child pulls him back.Older child : You must be joking friend, this really has to end Please forget the pond, go under a tap round the bend ! Singing the last two lines the Chorus runs after the small boy who exits. From the other team, a girl walking on all fours goes towards the pond. Every now and then she mimic a goat and says ‘Mehme Mehme’ as she sings and moves towards the pond. Goat : A goat is the queen of the water, her life depends on the water… All the children gape at her and the advertisement girl moves forward and twists her ear. Girl : Don’t you go to school?

Chorus : Whoever goes to that side, never returns alive ! Goat : So how do I quench my thirst? I am Water Queen  the First ! Chorus : We will find a way, that much we can sayThe children run in teams to the left and right. The wings fill up with water bottles and straws. The goat puts a straw in a bottle and drinks. Kaasni and Faizan come to the forefront and stand in the spotlight. Kaasni : I don’t understand one thing Faizan Faizan : What ? Kaasni : Why is everybody so scared of the village pond ? Faizan : Kaasni, there is danger… Kaasni : Ha ! Danger ! What danger ? Faizan : They say that the pond is under the spell of a jadugarni, a sorceress. Whoever goes to that side, human or goat, they say she begins to play her jaltarang. No ordinary jaltarang this one. It is a magical jaltarang ! Kaasni : Oh come on ! A jaltarang is a jaltarang. Whether my Abba plays it or your jadugarni ! Faizan : No Kaasni. Her jaltarang spells danger. D. A. N. G. E. R. As soon as its sound enters your ears, human or goat… Kaasni : And what happens ?Faizan : Don’t ask…danger on that side ! Kaasni : What danger ? That is just what I am asking… Faizan : They say that as soon as the sound of the jaltarang enters your ears… Kaasni : Yeah, yeah human or goat…what else ? Faizan : …you are as good as gone ! Kaasni : Where ? Faizan : That is what nobody knows ! Kaasni : Meaning ? Faizan : Meaning, that no sooner than the sound enters your ears, your life is gone ! Kaasni : Meaning…no breath ? Faizan : Yeah, no sense ! You lose it all…you lose your senses and you get sucked towards the source of the sound… He pauses and looks at Kaasni as if expecting her to complete the sentence. Kaasni : Human or goat !Faizan : Yes. Exactly like a magnet pulls a nail. You can keep calling out but won’t be heard. You look neither here nor there. Up or down. Not left nor right. You only look towards the source of the sound of the jaltarang… Kaasni : And then ? Faizan : And then vanish ! Kaasni : Vanish completely ? Faizan : Vanish completely ! Kaasni is momentarily silenced as if she has been deeply affected. Kaasni : Traceless ? Faizan : Absolutely without a trace ! Kaasni : You’ve seen it ? Faizan : No, I’ve heard Kaasni : From whom ? Faizan : From my elders ! Kaasni turns to the other children and calls out: Kaasni : Khala ! O Khala ! A girl playing Faizan’s mother appears.Khala : What is it Chashni ? Faizan checks her. Faizan : Not Chashni, Amma ! Kaasni ! Khala : Yes yes, that is what I mean What happened beti Ragini ? Faizan attempts to check her again. Faizan : But Amma… Kaasni stops him and asks Khala: Kaasni : Khala, that pond on that side… Before Kaasni can complete her sentence Khala stutters. Khala : The pond…danger on that side… Khala beats a hasty retreat. Kaasni tries to stop her. Kaasni : Khala ! Listen to me… Khala pauses. Kaasni : Have you seen that danger ? Khala : No, I’ve heard about it Kaasni : From whom ? Khala : From my elders ! Khala returns to where there are other children.Kaasni : Now let us ask her elders She calls out: Daadu, O Daadu ! A child pretending to walk with a stoop like an old man comes forward. Kaasni : Daadu… that pond that side… Daadu wants to hear no further and turns to leave. Kaasni : Daadu… the pond…Daadu returns and raises a finger to his lips to demand silence. Kaasni falls silent. Daadu comes close and whispers: Daadu : The pond… Danger… Kaasni : Have you seen anything ? Daadu : No, I’ve heard Kaasni : From whom ? Daadu : From my elders ! Saying this Daadu returns to where there are other children. Kaasni : So we will ask his… She opens her mouth to call out and stops as she remembers something. His elders are not even around so how can we ask… Faizan : Then ask the younger ones Kaasni : Yes…let us ask them… Kaasni turns towards the children and calls out. That part of the stage is lit up. The children are still playing with the goat.Daksha, Raksha, Shama, Rama, Chinku, Rinku ! Chorus : Why are you yelling ? We are all right here ! Kaasni : Now tell me, have any of you ever seen anything ? Chorus : Where ? Kaasni points to the right. Kaasni : There ! Chorus : There ! Over there is Danger ! Faizan : Has anybody ever seen that Danger…ous… Chorus : No, we’ve heard Faizan : From whom ? Chorus : From our elders… who else ? Faizan : But we asked the elders and they knew nothing… Chorus : But they all believe there is danger. Isn’t it ? The children get busy playing.Kaasni : That is the trouble with elders ! Faizan : What ? Kaasni : That they know nothing but believe many things Faiza : What should we do now ? Kaasni thinks for a moment and internally resolves to do something. Kaasni : Before we believe anything we must know something about it… Faizan : Meaning ? Kaasni : Meaning that we will go to the pond and solve the mystery of the jaltarang ! Faizan quails. Faizan : Pond ? Us ? Meaning you ? Alone ? Absolutely alone ? Kaasni : Yes…pond…not just me…you too ! Faizan : Me ? Never ! Kaasni : Oh yes ! Faizan : At no cost…never ! Kaasni : At every cost…yes… you and I and everybody !Faizan : Who everybody ? Kaasni : Daksha, Raksha, Shama, Rama, Chinku, Rinku, Pinku and… Faizan : Nobody will go there ! Kaasni : They will all go Faizan : Why don’t you ask them ? Kaasni calls out to the children: Kaasni : Daksha, Raksha, Shama, Rama, Chinku, Pinku !Chorus : Why are you yelling ? We are right here ! Kaasni : Who will come with us ? Chorus : Where ? Kaasni and Faizan point towards the pond together. Kaasni, Faizan : There ! All the children run away scared. Chorus : (The Chorus sings) No, no, no ji ! Over there is real danger, no one ever goes there No human, animal or stranger Over there lives a jadugarni, who doesn’t allow this journey When you hear the jaltarang, you know its time to run The hen vanishes and so does the rooster, boy or girl, brother or sister No living thing there is safe, beware the warning the jadugarni gave ! Kaasni : Have you all seen this ?Kaasni looks towards Faizan as if expecting his help. He pitches in. Faizan : Yeah, tell us… has anybody seen anything ? I mean… anybody at all ? Chorus shakes its heads and hums. Chorus : No no, not really ! Kaasni sings to the Chorus. Kaasni : That is the problem, you see that is the problem Doubts in my mind, many doubts in my mind For no reason at all, we end up in a bind We just heard something but never set eyes on the sight ! Chorus : What you say is absolutely true…but what can we do ? Kaasni and Faizan sing together to the children. Kaasni, Faizan : Believe it if you see it, believe it if you know itTrue or False, the choice is yours !A small boy who is in a habit of using big words steps forward and asks: Small boy : But what is the PLAN OF ACTION ? Faizan makes fun of him. Faizan : PLAN OF ACTION…where did you get this one from ? Small boy : But natural…from Papa ! Kaasni : Now, don’t scrap the two of you ! The plan of action is, tomorrow before sundown, we will set off towards the pond… Chorus : (in awe) Tomorrow ? You mean right the next day ? Kaasni : Yes, because there is no point in delaying it Girl : But if the elders find out about our plans ? Small boy : NO ISSUE…you have to take some risks if you want to find out the truth Faizan : Where did you hear this one ? From Papa ? Small boy : No, it is original ! Kaasni : You both are at it again !Faizan : This miniEnglishman does not know the simple fact that we come to this side to play anyway. While playing, we can head out towards the pond. In twos and threes. Nobody will suspect anything ! Small boy : No needle of suspicion…but why will nobody suspect anything ? Kaasni : Because they will all believe that we will never go to that sideThe girl playing the goat asks: Goat : And what if there is actually a jadugarni there ? Kaasni : That is what we are going to find out, so what is there to be scared of ? First boy : But what about her jaltarang ? Kaasni : We have a solution to that. We will take a lot of cotton wool along with us. We will make many many cotton buds with it. As soon as we hear the sounds of the jaltarang, we will stuff them in our ears. And we are out of the spell of the jadugarni !Faizan : So is everybody saying yes ? Chorus : Yes ! Kaasni : So we meet tomorrow. Everybody remember, tomorrow evening over here and then…They all complete her sentence pointing towards the pond. Chorus : …there !The lights go dim as if it is night. The children go to sleep on the stage. There is complete darkness for some time. A mother’s voice can be heard. Mother’s voice: Why have you woken up so early ? It is not morning yet ! As soon as this voice stops, the stage is lit up. Kaasni and Faizan are not seen. The other children start their morning routine as they sing. Some brush their teeth, while others wash their face, comb their hair, or pack their school bags. Everything is done in such a hurry that nothing is completed properly. It appears that all the children are very excited. Chorus : From the morning, I can only think of the evening Why isn’t the time passing ? It is so excitingTo be doing what we are doing ! What is bigger, the truth or fear ? We have to find out oh dear ! Believe it if you see it, believe it if you know it True or False, the choice is yours !During the song mothers, fathers or grandparents can be heard. Mother’s voice : Oh what is the tearing hurry today ? At least let the school gates open… Papa’s voice : At least put tooth paste on your brush ! Grandma’s voice: At least wash the soap off… As soon as the song ends the lights dim. Kaasni and Faizan are not seen and the first team of children enters scattering cotton wool in the air. It seems it is raining cotton wool on stage. The children sing as they scatter the cotton. First Team : Cotton, lots of cotton, its raining cotton As we wait for sundown, to solve the mystery of sound Cotton Cotton, more cotton all around !The children exit singing this song. The lights become brighter. From the other wing a second team of Mummy, Papa and elders enters. Somebody is carrying a shrunken pillow while somebody else is carrying a torn mattress or a quilt on their shoulder. The children sing in chorus. Second team : Cotton Cotton, where have you gotten ? Child with the pillow comes forward. Child with the pillow : This used to be a pillow, soft, fat, cosy and mellow Now it is flat and bad, it will make your sleep sad ! Second Team : Cotton Cotton, where have you gotten ?The child with the mattress on his head steps forth. The child with the mattress : Once this was a mattress, now it is in tatteress Lots of empty space, oh such a disgrace ! Second team : Cotton cotton, where have you gotten ? A girl steps forward with a quilt on her shoulder. Girl with : This used to be a quilt, before the cotton spilt the quilt Has it become a mat ? Or even worse than that ? Second Team : Cotton Cotton, where have you gotten ?The children with the pillow, mattress and quilt sing with an air of warning. Three children : Whoever has been up to mischief, Beware ! Beware ! Mummy and Nani have eyes at the back of their head To catch you and ground you, you can bet !All the children leave the stage. The scene changes. At the rear you can see a moon on the curtain. Children use coloured sheets to create the effect of waves in the pond. Many animal sounds can be heard to make the scene look scary. Faizan and Kaasni enter. Faizan looks scared and Kaasni thoughtful. Every now and again, Faizan attempts to flee but Kaasni manages to hold him back with a combination of threats and cajoling.Faizan : Should we turn back ? Kaasni : Why ? Faizan : Nobody else has turned up ! Kaasni : So what ? They will come… Faizan : Who knows if they will. Should we turn back ? Kaasni : (Scolding him) What is this turn back, let’s turn back ? Now that we are here, we will go back only after we have done what we came for ! Faizan : Alone ? Kaasni : If we are alone then so be it ! Faizan : All by ourselves ? Kaasni moves forward as she thinks. Faizan holds her hand. Kaasni : Let us sit on that rock and wait a while for them…Both of them sit to the right of the stage on a small rock. The silence deepens. First both of them face the pond. As soon as an animal’s distant cry gets louder, Faizan is scared and turns to face the audience instead. Kaasni tries in vain to make him face the pond again. In the end she also faces the audience. Kaasni : (to Faizan) A mouse would be better than you ! Faizan : How ? Kaasni : We are all after its life, but it still makes a hole inside our house… Faizan : That shows its stupidity ! Kaasni : No, that shows its spirit. It risks death to be able to live ! Faizan : If you will keep talking about life and death, I’m going… Faizan gets up to depart. Kaasni stops him.Kaasni : Ok, let us wait for a while. By then the others will come Faizan : Nobody is going to come ! Kaasni : Nobody is better than your mouse ! Kaasni falls silent. Both of them wait for the other children to come. After a long interval Faizan breaks the silence. Faizan : Nobody came here and nobody came there… Kaasni : There ? Faizan gestures towards the pond. Faizan : Yes, there ! Kaasni : Nobody is going to come there. All this magic, jadugarni, jaltarang… it is all a big myth! Faizan : But one thing is really strange ! Kaasni : What ? Faizan : The pond has neither fish nor frogs ! Kaasni turns and looks at the pond. Kaasni : Really !Faizan : (Suddenly fearful) No fish, no frogs, no Kaasni, no Faizan ! Kaasni : Be quiet, you great big wet cat ! Faizan : First you call me a mouse, then you call me a cat … I am not going to stay here ! Faizan is about to get up and stalk away in a temper. As he takes the first two steps, the sound of the jaltarang is heard. He stops in shock and then runs and holds on to Kaasni. Kaasni is also startled. The tempo of the jaltarang gradually increases. The waves in the water become bigger and on the curtain in the rear, colourful fish and frogs become visible. Kaasni : Wow ! What is that ? Faizan looks and as he spots the fish and frogs he hugs Kaasni even tighter. The sound of the jaltarang is very loud now. Kaasni shouts with all her strength. Kaasni : Who is there ? Nobody can be seen but the sound of the jaltarang gets even louder. Kaasni shouts again. Kaasni : Who is it ? Who is playing the jaltarang ?When there is no answer, Kaasni gently disentangles herself from Faizan and moves towards the waves. As she moves a step there is a loud splash and somebody slowly rises from the waves. Her hair is green and so is her dress. In front of her, in the water, floats a jaltarang. As soon as Kaasni sees that, she gets scared too. She runs and hugs Faizan. Seeing this the person begins to laugh. Slowly Kaasni turns towards her and seeing her laugh begins to laugh too. First it is a scared laugh and then a more full and hearty one. Seeing the two of them laugh Faizan also begins to laugh nervously in spurts. Kaasni asks the person:Kaasni : Who are you ? The jadugarni ? Hearing the question the person laughs even louder. Kaasni : Whoever you are …you could not be the jadugarni ! Sabzpari : Why ? Kaasni : Because the laughter of a jadugarni cannot make you laugh. It would frighten you instead ! Sabzpari : Oh ! You are very intelligent ! Faizan : Yes, we call her Akila Bua…our very own Aunty Intelligent ! Kaasni : Why don’t you tell us who you are ? Sabzpari : Sabzpari, the Green Fairy ! Kaasni, Faizan : Sabzpari ! Sabzpari : Yes, Sabzpari is my name Faizan : Oh I get it. You are shedding this pretty green light. That is why they must call you Sabzpari. Sabz means green in Urdu and a pari is a fairy !Sabzpari : (Impressed) You are no less ! Faizan preens a bit and looks at Kaasni. Kaasni : But why do people think that you are a jadugarni ? A sorceress ? Sabzpari : Human beings are like this. If they don’t know enough about something they begin to fear it. Then they give that thing such a name that others are afraid too ! Faizan points towards the jaltarang. Faizan : And this jaltarang ? Kaasni : People say there is some magic in this jaltarang. Not good magic. Some black magic. As soon as people hear its sound, they lose their senses and disappear in the depths of the pond… Sabzpari laughs loudly. Sabzpari : There is some magic in it but nothing that will harm anybody. This jaltarang is a keepsake of my mother !Faizan : Your mother ? Sabzpari : Yes, fairies have mothers too ! Faizan : It seems to me that you are ready to tell us a story… Sabzpari : Well…there is a story. If you both would like to listen…Kaasni : Tell us, but I hope it is not from the black and white era ! Sabzpari : It is an old story but I don’t think you will mind… Faizan : Then tell us ! Sabzpari : The story begins with this pond… Kaasni : With this pond ? Sabzpari : Yes, this pond was not always a pond ! Faizan : Then what was it ? A bed of sand ? Sabzpari : A river used to flow here… Kaasni, Faizan : A river ? Sabzpari : Yes…a river. A long, deep, wide and full flowing river. My mother’s childhood was spent here. Then there were fish and shells galore. As the number of people grew the river was hemmed in. By and by, it became such a weak, thin stream that my mother could not play any more and the fish could not swim. The people did the rest. Soon garbage from every house found its way here. The cloud of stink that rose up from the water was enough to choke anyone’s lungs. The stink affected my Nani…Faizan : Nani ? Sabzpari : Yes, fairies have Nanis too ! Kaasni : What happened to Nani? Sabzpari : The stink choked my Nani to death… Silence reigns as if everybody is in mourning. Sabzpari breaks it to continue with her story. Sabzpari : My mother was left all alone Faizan : All alone ? Sabzpari : Yes ! Kaasni : How could she live all alone ? Sabzpari : So she was sent to another river… Faizan : Another river ? Sabzpari : Yes, she went to my Dadi. That river was very far away. My mother grew up there and then I was born there Kaasni, Faizan : Then ? Sabzpari : Then the same thing happened to that river. The waste of countless cities began to sully the clear stream. This waste did not just stink, it was also poisonous. The poison that comes from factories. As time passed people grew more and more careless. It became harder for us to stay alive…Kaasni : It is happening to us too ! Sabzpari : That is why my mother said to me one day that I was old enough to look after myself and others. Since human beings don’t care for each other, I was to care for them too. I did not understand what she meant, so she told me that she was sending me where she had spent her childhood. She said, go and revive that drying stream… Faizan : But how ? Sabzpari : I had also asked the ‘how’ question ! Kaasni : So did Ma tell you what to do ? Sabzpari : When I asked Ma how I should revive it, she said, you will have to find your own way ! Faizan : By yourself ? Sabzpari : Yes, by myself ! Then Ma gave me this jaltarang and said if you begin to miss me, play a tune on this. I will fly to your side and the day, even after playing the jaltarang, I don’t come… Sabzpari fell silentKaasni : And ? Sabzpari : …then you will know that this river has choked me to death too… Sabzpari is deeply sorrowful. So are the children. Kaasni tries to lift her spirits. Kaasni : But you play the jaltarang everyday ?Sabzpari : Yes, when I came here, by the time it was evening, I would miss my mother very much. Then I would play the jaltarang. As soon as she would hear the sound, she would come to me and we would talk through the night. She would return before daybreak. This would happen everyday. As the sun set, my jaltarang would play and… Kaasni : And people thought this was the magic of a jadugarni. They were scared of the sound of the jaltarang ! Faizan : Oh yes, they were very scared ! Sabzpari : Yes…in a way this was a good thing. People stopped coming to this side. They stopped throwing garbage in the pond and the water level rose. Before I could find a way, my jaltarang had found it ! Kaasni : Your mother was so wise ! Faizan : Like me ! Kaasni slaps him playfully.Sabzpari : Ma was indeed very wise. Perhaps she had given me the jaltarang for this reason . (thinks about something) I don’t know what will happen now … Kaasni, Faizan: Why ? What happened now ? Sabzpari stays quiet for a bit and then says haltingly as if in pain: Sabzpari : Now Ma does not come to me… even if I play the jaltarang … Both the children are shocked. Kaasni, Faizan : You mean… There are tears in Sabzpari’s eyes and she sings in a sorrowful voice:Sabzpari’s song : I cannot hear my mother anymore Nothing can be heard of the musical score I have no friend, no partner, nobody cares As I sit and cry alone in despair I want my mother’s lap again Somebody tell her, I wait in vain ! As the song finishes, overcome with grief, Sabzpari sobs. Both the children are in tears too. This goes on for some time. Suddenly you can hear the noise of people searching for the two. Sabzpari hastily wipes her tears and tells the children: Sabzpari : Both of you must go now. It is really late. People are on their way here to look for the two of you… The noise of people approaching grows louder. Both the children spring to attention. Sabzpari : Just one moment…Both of them stop. The Sabzpari plays the jaltarang. A quick tune rises and then sinks immediately. Sabzpari : Tears in your eyes is not a sight I like to see ! Both the children touch their cheeks in surprise. Kaasni, Faizan : Where did our tears go ? Sabzpari : They are here ! Both the children stare at Sabzpari in astonishment. She spreads her hands towards them. On each of her palms is a shining green pearl. Sabzpari : Yes, it is the tears you shed for my mother and me. Now these are the pearls of our friendship that I will always keep safe with me ! Faizan : But what will we have ?Kaasni glares at him in mock anger. Sabzpari laughs. Faizan : Like a keepsake… something to remember you by… Sabzpari : You will get a keepsake. A keepsake of our friendship… As she says this Sabzpari goes down into the water and disappears with a splash. The stage is in darkness and the sounds of people are audible and then small lanterns bob in the dark. Every now and then, you can hear voices of people calling out the names of Kaasni and Faizan. After some time, the lanterns leave the stage. The stage lights come on. Centre stage is the Sabzpari’s jaltarang. Faizan, Kaasni : Oh ! The jaltarang ! Both of them run up to it. The keepsake of our friendship ! Kaasni : Come, let us tell everybody right away !Both of them start calling out to the other children: Kaasni : Daksha, Raksha, Shama… Faizan : Rama, Chinku, Rinku… Chorus : Why are you yelling ? We are right here !All the children arrive pellmell on the stage and stop short when they see the jaltarang. Seeing the others hesitate, the smallest boy steps forward. He gets close to the jaltarang and without touching its cups inspects it very carefully. Then he looks deeply at Kaasni and Faizan and suddenly lets out a yell. Small boy : Incredible ! As soon as he speaks, all the others jump and begin to sing and dance. Chorus : It is all clear now, the story tells you how ! The children pick up the cups of the jaltarang and exit the stage singing.Faizan : There is no magic and no jadugarni We are telling you oh Daddy Mummy ! Kaasni : We just want to say, be wise and use reason to find the real way ! Our village… From the right the first team enters. They have their backs to the audience. First Team : Yeah Yeah Yeah ! Kaasni, Faizan : Our pond… From the left the second team enters. They also have their backs to the audience. Second Team : Yeah Yeah Yeah ! Both the teams, from one end of the stage to the other, present the scene of a wave in the water and sing. Chorus : We love our village, we do, and the pond is ours toooo !As the song ends, all the children turn towards the audience. Each of the children has a big cardboard square hanging from their neck. These squares have pictures of fish, frogs, herons, cranes, crab, turtle, water hens, pipal, sycamore and other plants found in the water, made by the children. The sound of the jaltarang can be heard and from the wave created by the children, the picture of the jaltarang emerges gradually. The lights dim slowly and the whole scene turns into a tableau.

"Captain Raju steered the fighter jet to a sharp left, just missing the Eiffel Tower. ""Phew! Paris is certainly a tricky place to fly in, "" he thought, heart beating fast. Suddenly, he heard a noise from the cockpit – *BEEP BEEP BEEP* What was it? Was he on enemy ground? Did the engine have a problem?*BEEP BEEP BEEP* Raju woke up with a start at the sound of the alarm. ""It was all just a dream, "" he sighed. But, wait. There’s no time for disappointment! Today was a big day.""I am going to take my first aeroplane ride! Amma, I’m awake! "" His mother was zipping up the suitcase. ""Good morning, Raju! "" she said. ""I’m so excited to see your sister. It’s been so many months since we saw Arya! Get ready quickly. ""Raju was inside an airport for the first time in his life. He helped his mother lift the suitcase on to a moving belt. The belt carried the bags into a big machine. A strict lady in a uniform was looking at a small screen behind the machine. Raju was shocked when he looked at the screen. It showed not just his bag but everything inside it— his new sports shoes, his binoculars, everything! ""Xray vision! Just like Captain Raju has. . . "" gasped Raju. Raju opened his mouth to ask the lady something, but his mother stopped him. ""Hush, Raju. She is on the security team. She has to make sure passengers are not carrying dangerous items like explosives or weapons. Best not to disturb her. ""At last, Raju found himself in a large hall. The walls were made of glass and he could see dozens of aeroplanes outside. One was about to take off. ""Pilots have such important jobs, don’t they, Amma? "" ""Of course. Just like bus drivers or ship captains, they are responsible for the safe travel of so many passengers. """"Chechi is so lucky. She’s been on so many planes! I can’t wait till I’m old enough. "" Amma laughed. ""Oh yes. Arya certainly has. But you are only nine years old. There’s plenty of time for you, Raju. "" Raju noticed people lining up at Gate . ""That’s our gate, Amma. It’s time to board the plane! ""Ten minutes later, they were in their seats, all buckled up. Raju looked out of the window as the plane finally began to move. It started slowly, but in a few seconds it was going so fast that Raju felt his seat vibrate. Suddenly, the shaking stopped. The giant plane was in the air! ""Amma, we’re flying! "" ""We are! Listen, Raju. They’re making an announcement. Shhh! "" Someone’s voice came from the speakers. A familiar voice. . .""Ladies and gentlemen, this is your Captain, Arya. Welcome aboard! "" ""Chechi!

There's sweetness in the holidays of juicy mangoes from trees, Of the pleasant cool sensation of unending twilight breeze.Holidays are like scenes from plays of lying awake, pretending to sleep. They are islands of my own kingdom of independence that I can keep.Holidays are gift coupons With an 'off' on studies and A 'bumper sale' on play. They have the tangy taste of 'golgappas' The joy of 'I spy' and 'dhappa's Ah! the taste of a holiday! Holidays Loose change in a pocket, A trick by schools and gone like a rocket!That cowardfaint hearted slave to calendar days, Perhaps quick melting chocolate best describes our holidays!	./Story text files/473.txt	630	15	6.770491803278689	41	20	121	69.11111111111111	2	7	19	12.666666666666666	2	7	25	36	4	1.7058823529411764	52	16

"Swoosh came the wind. A sheet of paper floated in. Manju picked it up and sat down to draw the sun. ""Oh, this looks horrible! she said. Manju crumpled the paper and threw it out of the window. The paper fell on Wasim’s head. “Ah, a ball!” he said happily.Wasim threw the crumpled paper ball up into the air and watched it come down. He threw it higher, and it came down faster. Wasim aimed the paper ball at Syeda, his sister. “Got you!” he shouted with glee.Syeda picked up the crumpled paper. She stuck a pencil into it and said, “Would you like this lollipop? When I am big, I am going to sell many kinds of lollipops in my sweet shop.”Just then, Bittu came in. “May I have the lollipop please?” he asked. He pretended to eat the sweet and then rolled up the crumpled paper. “Testing, testing, mike testing, one, two, three!” he said. “Now I am going to sing you a song.”Bittu finished singing a film song very loudly. Manju took the crumpled paper from Bittus hands. She smoothened the paper and made a boat.“Bittu, the famous singer will sail all around the world in this big ship!” “May I come with you too?” asked Wasim.Wasim picked up the boat. Very carefully, he smoothened the paper. Then he folded it like a handkerchief. He cut out a corner. Then Wasim opened the paper.“Look here, all of you! Smile please!” he said as he held up the paper with a hole in the centre. Syeda, Bittu and Manju smiled. Then they grinned. Soon they were giggling. Wasim crumpled his paper camera.Just then, Anil came along with his donkey. He picked up Manju’s pencil and drew lines around the hole in the paper. “That’s the best sun I have ever seen!” said Manju.Anil's donkey grabbed the paper sun from Manju's hand and gobbled it up fast. He burped loudly. Then the donkey had a very strange look on his face. Now who can tell if it was because he had eaten very fast without chewing well, or if it was because he had eaten up the sun?"	./Story text files/113.txt	1929	13	5.785714285714286	164	32	125	36.84313725490196	40	11	28	8.019607843137255	33	18	123	73	4	1.3598326359832635	227	12

No part of this text may be reproduced for commercial use without express permission of the author. For Jacques and SonjaMac was a very big dog. Mac lived in a house with a very small kitchen, where Mac loved to sleep on the cool floor. This caused lots of problems.Mrs Smith would come into the kitchen and ask, “Why have I got such a large dog in the middle of my very small kitchen?” Mac would see he wasn't wanted, and slink away to the hall where the floor was almost as cool, but the smells weren't as nice.Just when Mac had begun to settle down Baby Katia came crawling along the floor of the hall. She bumped into Mac, and let out a small squeal, ” EEEIKK. ” . Mrs Smith looked over and threw her hands up in the air again, saying, “Why have I got such a big dog in my small passage way?” Picking up the baby she chased Mac out of the hall.Mac looked up with droopy Mac eyes, and saw he was not wanted there either, and decided to slink away to the bathroom. In the shower the floor was always cool, sometimes a little damp, but always perfectly shaded for snoozing. Mac didn't like the soap smell, but he thought maybe at least I'll be safe here out of the way for a while.Right at that moment, Katia's big brother Tyron, who hated getting up too early in the morning, choose to get up and wandered down stairs to have a shower. When Tyron saw Mac in the shower he said to him, “Mac, I am happy for you to have a shower with me, but I don't think you are going to like it.” Mac looked up at Tyron with his big droopy Mac eyes, and rumbled a Mac rumble, ” GRMMRMRL.”Mac tried to decide if Tyron wanted him to go or stay. He paused in thought, half standing up and half lying down in the shower. Tyron said: “Mac if you don't believe me I can show you.” He turned the tap on very softly to let Mac know what might be coming.Mac suddenly felt something cold and wet, he looked at Tyron a bit startled. Then he realized Tyron was just warning him there was more coming and he wouldn't much like it, and perhaps he better go. So he ambled back to the hall – looked around to see if the 'coast was clear', and sunk down into his favorite snooze position.The coast was not clear for long, Mr Smith came back from reading his paper and saw Mac. “Mac, old boy, why do you, such a big dog, choose to sit in such a small passage?” he asked. “You know you shouldn't be here, Mrs Smith will find you and you don't want that do you?” Mac looked up with his big droopy Mac eyes, and rumbled softer this time. . . . “Grmmgrl.”Mac didn't know what to do now, it was hot outside, and the new puppy would be out there and want to play. Mac didn't want to play now, he wanted to sleep. The only place Mac could go for really good shade was on the balcony, but he was afraid of climbing up the stairs. The stairs were so BIG and STEEP and SCARY looking.He tried to slink back to the kitchen, but Mrs Smith spied him creeping in, “Mac, why do I have such a big dog trying to creep into my small kitchen again?” She threw her hands up again, for the third time that morning. “Mac what will I do with you?  Outside now!”It was getting closer to midday, and it was getting hotter by the second. Mac wished he didn't have a fur coat. There were lots of trees to lie under, but the ground was all prickly and Mac didn't like it. He looked at the stairs, he wanted to go up and lie under the table on the cool balcony floor, but they were terrifying. They were so big and steep, he didn't know how he would come down. Maybe he would get stuck up there, and if no one found him he might miss his dinner. Or maybe his legs would fall through the gaps and he would be trapped, Then the Cat would taunt and tease him until someone came to the rescue.While thinking of all the terrible things that might happen if he tried, he slowly ambled over to his least hated tree where he lay down in the prickly grass. Soon after he lay down to snooze, the new puppy came bounding up to him. “Whatchya doing Mac? Watchya doing?” “GrrrrrrMm” . Said Mac. “Whatchya doing Mac? Watchya doing? !” “GRRMMMLL” Said Mac, this time in a more menacing Growly voice. The puppy should know what that meant, he thought.But noooo. . . The puppy was young and very eager but not yet very bright, “Mac – watcha doing, don't ya wanna come and play with me?” She said, still waiting expectantly for a reply. Mac tried to ignore the puppy and rolled over to face the tree.“Mac, I'm gonna go chase the Cat – I saw him just now. Mac don't you wanna chase the Cat with me?” Mac put his paws over his head and pretended not to see or hear. She just ran up the stairs on to the balcony, if you wanna come with me, I think she's trapped up there.”Mac was going to roll over again when his ears pricked up as he caught the word 'Balcony'. “Little Dipper” , he said slowly in a bit of a mumble grumble, not wanting to sound too interested, ” Do you know how to get on to the balcony?”Little Dipper didn't quite understand what he said because he was mumbling, but was so surprised and glad that Big Mac was talking to her she was eager to give a good answer. ” Sure I do” , she replied. ” So how do you?” asked Mac. ” How do you what?” replied Little Dipper ” How do you get onto the balcony?” asked Mac. ” Well by the stairs of course” , replied Little Dipper.Mac shuddered a bit at the thought of the stairs, but tried not to let Dipper see. ” Well I know by the stairs, but how?” Mac asked. “Those stairs are awfully big, and you are so very small. And what if you can't get down again?” Mac inquired further. ” But I normally always get down – why shouldn't I?” replied Dipper. ” You always get down OK?” said Mac. ” Yep always” , said Dipper. “But how?” asked Mac.Dipper looked at Mac, she was only one and a half, turning two years old soon, but she had been climbing stairs ever since she could remember. She tried to think how she did it, but couldn't remember – she just did, and she found it difficult to understand why Mac was asking so many questions.Then she thought, maybe it's because he's never climbed the stairs. Dipper thought very hard, and very long, until she decided for sure she had never seen Mac climb the stairs. “Mac” , she said, ” do you want me to show you how I climb the stairs?” Mac, coughed a little, and mumbled, “ “Grmmbl, er, well I would. But just to make sure you don't hurt yourself or get stuck.” Then he added, “You better show me a few times, to make really sure.”Dipper agreed, and they walked off together for the first time since she could remember. Mac, pleased that Dipper would show him the stairs, and Dipper, pleased that Mac wanted to play with her at last.At the top of the stairs they settled down under the table on the cool balcony floor. The Cat was gone, but Mac and Dipper had both forgotten. They lounged down in their favourite snooze positions and dreamed of pleasant doggy things.The EndMORE BOOKS!

The sun is just waking up in Mizoram, its rays nudging the Dampa Tiger Reserve to life. Bamboo stems huddle together, towering over the narrow mud paths. The River Seling flows by, gurgling away. Swathing canopies rise, as if to meet the sky. Morning dew drips to the forest floor, making a gentle pitterpatter in the quiet of dawn.No, not quiet. Still, maybe. Peaceful, definitely. But not quiet. Forests are not quiet places.Crickets chirp. Great slaty woodpeckers cackle from treetops. Hoolock gibbons whoop together. The call of the great Indian hornbill echoes through the forest. Morning dawns like an orchestra in perfect harmony, with all the forest residents calling, “Good morning, I am up!” In this lively medley, a forest guard is hard at work.Zakhuma Don is checking a camera trap on a tree close to the river. He is a guard with the anti poaching camp of the Mizoram Forest Department. He patrols the forest every day to make sure that no one or nothing harms the forest. The camera traps help him keep watch even at night, when he is fast asleep at the camp.Zakhuma scrolls through the camera trap footage from the previous night. A hog badger caught unawares. The large nose of a barking deer. Zakhuma smiles. It’s these little moments that he cherishes. He loves this forest, and everything that lives in it. Looks like it was an uneventful night.Zakhuma loves photography as a way of understanding animal behaviour. So when he patrols, he takes photos and videos on his personal camera. Later, he shares these images and stories with the local people of Mizoram and also people who live far, far away. After all, so little is known about the forests of the Northeast of India.Zakhuma has been able to take photographs of rare animals – the grey peacock pheasant and even the elusive clouded leopard. He now knows that the clouded leopard is an expert climber and has impressively long canines.Wait a minute! What was that? Zakhuma stares at a video – three men slinking away into the darkness. He plays it again.Zakhuma replaces the camera trap, and starts looking around for clues that the men may have left behind. He wonders if they belong to the village in the buffer zone, the area bordering the reserve. Mizos, Riangs and Chakmas* live around Dampa. Sometimes, they enter the reserve for wood, or to fish or hunt animals, even though it’s not allowed. *Mizos, Riangs and Chakmas are tribes native to the Northeast India. They are also known as hill tribes.Zakhuma and his team have been worried about another threat to the jungle. People have started to plant too many palm trees, since palm oil from the fruits brings in quick money. Making room for these plantations could deplete the entire forest. The forest department has been spreading awareness about the importance of preserving the forest and its wildlife, and about penalties for wrongdoers. But Zakhuma knows that change will take time.Zakhuma moves swiftly along the river. He sees something that makes him stop. A snare set up by poachers. A barking deer trapped in its clutches. Zakhuma’s heart goes out to the deer. No matter how many times he comes across this situation, it still hurts him to see an animal in pain.He cautiously approaches the frightened deer. The animal is exhausted from trying to escape but thankfully, still alive. Zakhuma quickly gets to work. He radios his department for help, and in the meantime, tries to calm the deer. Help arrives and the guards cut the snare, being careful not to hurt the animal.Free at last, the deer bounds away into the forest. Everyone is relieved – the deer is going to be all right! But there is still work to be done.The poachers will return to check on the trap. So some of the team hides and lies in wait. As dusk falls, and the light starts to dim, the wind carries low, whispered voices to them. Zakhuma recognises the three men from the camera trap video. The poachers approach stealthily, with cloth bags, in the hope of carrying their trapped loot back.But before they can escape, Zakhuma and his team surround them. The poachers are nabbed and taken back to the camp. It’s over quickly! At the camp, they will be questioned by the authorities.Darkness is falling over Dampa as Zakhuma navigates the steep and hilly terrain, picking his way back through the trees and bamboos. He stops to listen to the creaks of the bamboos. It’s like they are talking to him.It’s these secrets of nature, these things of startling beauty that inspire Zakhuma to protect the forest every day. It’s not easy – there is fighting at the border, poachers that turn violent, and the struggle of the small salary he earns.But for him, this is all in a day’s work. Zakhuma belongs to the forest and the forest to him.Meet Zakhuma Zakhuma works as a forest guard and wildlife photographer with the Mizoram Forest Department in Dampa Tiger Reserve in Mizoram. This is one of India’s more remote tiger reserves with a very difficult terrain. He is a selftaught photographer. Zakhuma has created a valuable archive of photographs of Dampa’s biodiversity: plants, animals, insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mosses and fungi.	./Story text files/330.txt	5153	20	6.339882121807466	387	122	151	61.096385542168676	37	46	24	11.626506024096386	30	53	254	255	5	1.6424870466321244	470	109
We are off to see spiders, Some large as a plate, some small as a pin. We will see so many spiders, Our heads will spin, spin, spin!“Is that an ant or a spider?” asks Kaveri. It looks like an ant, but it has eight legs. “Uff, ants are insects. All insects have six legs, not eight. But you are right, this does look like an ant!” says Shivi. “Full marks,” says Shama. “It is an antmimic spider.” Kaveri and Shivi love being with Shama. She is studying to be a wildlife biologist, and is full of fun facts and stories about different animals and plants.Just then, Kaveri spots the sac spider. It's neatly rolled up inside a leaf! “How did you find it?” asks Shivi. “Ah! When you get to know the different signs that spiders make, you start finding them everywhere,” Shama says, with a wink.We are off to see spiders, Some fat, some thin, some hairy. They have eight legs and eight eyes, But don’t worry! They are not scary!“Ummm, that looks like a crab!” says Shivi, squinting at a yellow flower. “Ha!” Shama says. “It’s the crab spider. And look! It has caught a poor bee that was visiting the flower for nectar.” “Ah, no wonder the bee didn’t see the spider. It’s almost the same colour as the flower,” says Kaveri.“Look, look,” yells Shivi, pointing towards the leaves on the damp ground. A female wolf spider is carrying her egg sac. “And there is another one! Ooh! There are hundreds of tiny baby spiders on her back!” Shama whispers in awe.We are off to see spiders, Oh where, oh where, oh where? On grass, on leaves, on flowers, Here, there and everywhere!Shivi is leaning on a tree trunk when suddenly he jumps in fright! Something scuttled by at lightning speed. “There you are!” Shama says, moving closer. “See how well the twotailed spider blends with the tree bark?”“Here’s a spider that looks like it has only four legs,” Kaveri says excitedly, pointing towards a bush. The spider has spun a wheelshaped web between two plants. “What a beautiful zigzag pattern! This has to be the cross spider,” Shama exclaims.We are off to see spiders, So far we have had quite a catch! Hey! Someone’s spinning lovely webs, On this grassy patch.Kaveri, Shivi and Shama stumble upon a sheetandtunnel web spider. “So many webs,” Kaveri exclaims. “They look like delicate sheets!” “This juicy grasshopper stuck in the web will become spider food soon. Slurp!” says Shivi.“Right! It’s time to go home now,” says Shama, looking at her watch. “I have to study for my class tomorrow.” Kaveri and Shivi’s faces fall. “Oh don't worry, there’s plenty to see at home as well,” says Shama.Back home, Shama spies the common house spider. “Oh! There’s the daddylonglegs spider.” “They are funny,” says Kaveri. “They dangle upside down and have long, long legs.”We saw so many wondrous spiders, On grass, trees and flower heads.Let’s crawl and look for more of them, Will we find some under our beds?Spider Guide Meet the spiders that Kaveri, Shivi and Shama see on their walk. Twotailed spiders These spiders get their name because of their long spinning organs that look like a tail! With a flat body, these spiders blend in very well on tree trunks and walls. Antmimic spiders They behave just like ants and look like them too! These spiders in disguise trick animals and birds that like to eat spiders.Crab spiders With a much longer and stronger pair of front legs, these spiders often extend their legs while waiting to catch their food. This pose makes them look very much like a crab! Wolf spiders You will often find wolf spiders scuttling on the ground, especially where there are leaves and shrubs. A female wolf spider carries egg sacs attached to her spinning organs. When the sac opens, hundreds of baby spiders climb onto her back and stay there for several days.Sac spiders These spiders rest inside silken sacs that they make within rolled leaves and blades of grass. They come out of their silken retreats when they have to hunt for food. Sheetandtunnel web spiders These spiders make beautiful and delicate sheet like webs. A tunnel at the end of the sheet web is the perfect hiding place for them. They dart out when an insect gets caught in the web.Daddylonglegs spiders These common house spiders are found on the ceiling, in corners of houses and sheds. Their cobwebs may look untidy, but they catch a lot of flying insect pests. Cross spiders When cross spiders are on their wheelshaped webs, they look like they’re making an Xshape! They are also called signature spiders because of the zigzag pattern they make on their webs.	./Story text files/129.txt	4533	17	5.79835390946502	406	80	136	49.943820224719104	46	43	24	9.92134831460674	39	50	292	194	5	1.3964601769911504	520	45
"""This is the story of the giant Beyasura, the asura who loved to sing, "" says Apu, beginning his story. Dida and Pia move closer to Apu to listen. ""Beyasura LOVED to sing, but his fellow asuras HATED his voice, "" says Apu. ""So they sent him away to the top of the mountain, where no one could hear him sing. ""Apu climbs up on Dida’s big bed, pretending it is a tall mountain. In his scariest asura voice, Apu as Beyasura begins to sing. ""'Saaaaaaa…' Beyasura began, warming up. 'Rayyyyyyyyy…. ' he sang louder. The sun’s rays dimmed a little in alarm. 'Gaaaaaa…. ' he yelled even louder. Beyasura was feeling happy now. So he decided to do some Kathak dance. """" 'Dhadhindhindha, ' Beyasura kept time, stamped his feet and twirled. Feeling more and more happy, he sang along, 'Maaaaaa… Paaaaa…. ' The mountain, which had been sleeping in peace, woke up, all frightened. The asura’s singing and dancing made the mountain tremble. KABOOM! Fell the rocks. DHADAAAAM! The rocks shook the Earth. """"Do you know what happened when the rocks fell? "" Apu asks his audience. Dida shakes her head, with a naughty smile. ""I will tell you what happened, "" Apu says. ""The earth shook! As the mountain trembled, everything started moving. Even Beyasura, a gigantic giant, swayed from side to side! "" ""The earth swung this way…"" says Apu, rolling on the floor. ""Then it swung the other way. "" Apu rolls some more.Just then, the earth actually starts to move! The bed shakes just like the mountain in Beyasura’s story. ""Apu, stop singing! "" yells Pia. ""You are frightening the mountain. "" ""It’s not me, "" says Apu. ""The whole room is shaking. ""Dida, Apu and Pia fall silent. Even Bholu doesn’t bark. Then, there is another bigger jolt. ""The floor is shaking! "" yells Apu. ""It’s all Beyasura’s fault! "" cries Pia. ""No, no, "" says Dida, calmly. ""It is an earthquake. """"There’s no time to run outside. Quick, go under the bed, "" says Dida. They all sit under Dida’s tall bed and hold on to its legs. But the earth continues to shake.TUMBLE! The dolls on the shelf shake and fall. SPLASH SPLASH! The water in the jug starts splashing around. ""Whoooa! "" Apu yells as he feels the floor shake. ""Aaaaoooo! "" whimpers Bholu. Apu’s stomach feels like Beyasura is stomping inside it.Finally, the shaking stops. Dida waits for two minutes to see if it starts again. But now the earth is firm. It has stopped quaking! They all crawl out from under the bed. ""We can go outside now, "" says Dida.""Shouldn’t we have run out? "" asks Apu. ""Only if you are near an exit, "" says Dida. ""If you are upstairs and in a strong building, you should go under the bed or a sturdy table and hold on so it does not move away from you. If there is nothing, go to a corner of the room and stay away from windows, doors and anything that can fall like light bulbs and fans. ""Apu, Dida, Pia, and Bholu go out of their house. Some of the flower pots have fallen and are smashed. A crack has appeared on the outside wall of their house. People are standing on the road, talking to each other. Is it safe to go back indoors?Apu picks up a fallen plant. He puts his hand on the earth. ""Beyasura will sing softly next time, "" he promises the earth.Did Beyasura really make the earth shake with his singing? No, earthquakes have been occurring ever since the earth was formed, even when it was a really young planet. The top layer of the earth, the one that we can see, is called the crust. Underneath it is another layer called the mantle. Then there is the inner and outer core. The crust is made up of tectonic plates that glide over the mantle, and move very slowly and rub against each other. Sometimes, the plates get caught against each other. Then the plates are not able to slide as they usually do and tension builds up. When the plates suddenly move away, energy waves are released. This makes the earth quake as the waves travel through the ground. And that’s how an earthquake happens! The spot where the plates move apart is called the focus. The place on the earth right above the focus is called the epicenter.Layers of the Earth The layers mentioned here are shown in the picture on the left. . Crust . Mantle . Core Earthquakes are measured on a scale called the Richter Scale that ranges from  (small, very less damage),  (moderate),  (very severe). The instrument that measures earthquakes is called a seismograph (shown as  in the picture).Where in India and the world can earthquakes happen? The tectonic plates run under the surface of the earth throughout the globe and have been mapped by scientists. In India, the most earthquakeprone areas are Kashmir, the middle and central Himalayas, the northeastern states, parts of Bihar and the Rann of Kutch. Places like Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Maharashtra, Andaman and Nicobar Islands also get earthquakes often. More earthquakes happen here because the Indian land mass is moving and pushing against Asia. Places where earthquakes strike often are called high seismic zones (shown on pg ). Some other places around the world that have seen devastating earthquakes are Japan, Indonesia, Italy, Turkey, Chile, Alaska and California in the United States.What to do if you are in an earthquake . Don’t panic. . If you are indoors and in a high rise building or a building that is strong, drop to the ground and take cover under a bed or a sturdy table, and hold on. Stay away from objects that can break away from the walls and fall on you. Do not go near a door unless it is very strong. . If you are near an exit or in an old, unsteady building, move out quickly and calmly. . If you are outside during the earthquake, find an open spot away from buildings, streetlights and walls, and stay there. . If you are on a steep hillside, move away from the side of the hill in case of landslides and falling rocks."	./Story text files/126.txt	5820	16	5.648	506	119	161	47.91596638655462	72	47	34	9.873949579831933	55	64	359	266	4	1.3676268861454046	651	78

Princess Nila is worried. The Surya Championship, the famous weightlifting contest in her kingdom, is only a month away. But according to the rules, she must weigh  kilos. Not  kilos. She still has to put on two kilos!The Surya Championship was named after the greatest athlete in all the seven kingdoms of the east. Nila has waited all her life to participate.Nila loves to lift weights. As a child, she would lift dogs tables chairs cupboards. . .… and even the King!“How did practice go?” asks the Queen. “Fine,” says Nila. “But I still have to put on two kilos!” The Queen gives her a boiled egg. “Eat well,” she says. “You’ll get there.”As she eats, Nila remembers the last championship. That was four years ago, when she was just twelve. Prince Vikram of Nethil had won then. He had been far ahead of everyone else.Nila knows that when she grows older, the King has plans of getting her married to Prince Vikram. But she has other plans. Nila wants to go to Taibar, the land of snow. It has the best sports school in the entire kingdom.“May I have another boiled egg?” she asks the Queen. The Queen laughs. Many years ago, she had been like Nila — wanting to run, swim, ride horses and win the Championship. But that was a long, long time ago.As the days pass, Princess Nila trains hard. She runs up and down the mountain. She swims in the river. She eats meat, vegetables and fruits. Her skin turns golden brown, the colour of sunset.The week before the Championship, she stands on a weighing scale.  kilos at last! Nila is thrilled. She flexes her muscles. She cannot stop smiling. “I’ve done it!”On the day of the Championship, Nila is ready. This year, the competition is tougher. Nila marks out the strong weightlifters. The boy with the yellow turban. The girl with the tight plait. And of course, Prince Vikram.They lift rocks. They lift logs. They lift treasure chests. They lift cupboards. The judges watch. Is the arm shaking? Is the leg steady? Is the stance correct? Nila clenches her teeth. She can feel every muscle in her body. Every drop of sweat.Vikram is in the lead. But Nila is right behind him. The final round begins. They have to lift the ancient iron throne.The others are good. But Nila is better. She applies every ounce of her strength. She grunts, biting back the pain. When she almost gives up, she thinks of Surya, and Taibar. The iron throne rises in the air.The final scores are displayed. Princess Nila has won! “Now you’re worthy of being a champion’s wife,” says the King proudly. Princess Nila smiles. “No,” she says. “Now, I am the champion.”	./Story text files/38.txt	2585	16	5.9037037037037035	220	50	100	32.58441558441559	64	13	20	6.987012987012987	56	21	129	141	4	1.2692307692307692	320	18

Introducing Philautus, the tree frog Philautus, or Thavalai, as he was known to some friends, had not come down from the Big Tree his whole life. But then, neither had his father. Or mother. Or grandparents. Or great grandparents. Before that, who knew? They had lived there on the Big Tree for as long as anyone could remember. He had been born on the Big Tree, in a small nook, and splashed around as a little froglet in the tiny puddles of water that collected in the tree holes. As had his father before him.Sometimes the other frogs made fun of him, because he had never been a tadpole. ‘You were not a tadpole’ they chanted. But Thavalai was a tree frog and proud of it. The Big Tree was in the middle of a shola forest, a dark, deep and wet forest, dripping with dew, dank with mildew.Cosy sholas and harsh grasslands The shola nestled snugly at the bottom of a valley and was surrounded by undulating hills of grassland. Little fingers of shola forest snaked up the hill slope where rainfed streams had cut their courses. And as much as the seasons raged out in the grassland, inside the shola it was always cool. The grassland is a harsh land, Thavalai’s father used to say. It’s sizzling hot in the day and freezing cold at night. But here in the shola, it’s always cool and moist. That’s why you must always stay here.Thavalai and his friends, discussing their world Thavalai had heard all these names, but he had no idea what these places were. Bhavani, Bangitappal, Sispara, Nadugani, Maduppumalai shola, the shola of folds, and so on. But he had a few friends who had been around a bit. Warbler flew down from the Himalayas each year and had a bird’seye view of the whole of the Western Ghats. Of which the Nilgiris was a tiny part. Of which Mukurthi was a section. Of which Sispara was a slice. In which the tree stood.Thavalai decides to explore the world When Thavalai heard about the big blue sea from his friends, he knew he had to see it. His frog friends scoffed. Warbler said it was minuscule compared to the seas that she had seen while migrating south in winter. But Thavalai was determined to go. And one morning, he came down the Big Tree, hopping from branch to branch. He crawled down slowly, toepads gripping the bark till he reached the ground. The soil was moist and covered with dead leaves. A shrew scurried past. Around him, slugs and grubs crawled. Thavalai was tempted to climb straight back up the Big Tree to the safety of his home. Instead he hopped towards the edge of the shola.Out in the open As he got closer to the light, Thavalai’s heart beat faster and faster. What would he find? Was it the end of the world? Or was there an endless supply of food? In other words, frog heaven? When he got there finally, it was three parts fog and one part frog. A heavy, clammy mist lay over the grassland, and Thavalai could not see anything. And far away, he heard croaking. Slowly, he stepped out on to the grassland for the very first time. The cold surprised him. It was all around, the chill in the wind, the frost on the ground. And instead of a cosy cover of leaf litter, there was nothing but the crackling fronds of grasses. Briefly the fog cleared and Thavalai saw the most amazing sight. The entire hill opposite was blue. It was covered with a carpet of kurinji, the little shrub which flowered only once in twelve years. And on the edges of the shola were the sturdy rhododendron with their shocking red flowers.Encounter with Bufo As Thavalai hopped down the hill, he could hear the rushing of water. Within minutes, he came upon a little mountain stream, winding its way down a small hill, decorated with little rocks. And in one of the rocky corners was the biggest frog that Thavalai had ever seen. Bufo, fat and prosperous, was sitting at the edge of the cold and rocky stream. He looked smug and satisfied with himself. A long cluster of eggs floated in the water, that would soon become little Bufo tadpoles. Bufo and his relatives were found throughout the country. Field, forest or city, you could find Bufo.“Oh, Giant Frog, do you live in this bog?” asked Thavalai. “I am a toad, you little runt,” Bufo answered pompously, “I live everywhere.”Sally A, the grassland lizard Sally A was at home in the grassland. Like her relative, the garden lizard, Sally could change colours when she wanted. When Thavalai landed next to her, she turned a greenbrown and merged with the grass behind her. After a few minutes, she assured herself that this tiny frog posed no threat, and reappeared.“Hi there, I’m Thavalai the tree frog and I’m looking for the big blue sea,” Thavalai said. “Let me show you,” said Sally A eagerly and scooted to the top of the hill, Thavalai hopping as fast as he could behind her. “Go down that hill, and up the next one, and down again, and along the river and over the little hill and you will find the sea,” said she.Ahaetulla, the grassland snake Thavalai hopped rapidly down a little path towards the valley they called Bangitappal. He fell through the grass, slid down the rock, skated on the moss, till he was in the middle of the valley. Surrounded by hills and fog, Thavalai felt very lonely. And suddenly he was eye to eye with a creature that frogs fear the most. Inches away, the long slits of pupils and flickering tongue of a snake looked straight into Thavalai’s eyes. Thavalai was transfixed with fear. But Ahaetulla, the grass snake, had had a very fulfilling day. He had just eaten a toad and was done for the week. Languidly, he slithered up to Thavalai and asked how he might help.Thavalai explained his quest and was rewarded with a flicker of the tongue. Ahaetulla asked Thavalai to follow him up the hill, and said he would show him a path that led straight down to the sea.Finds the big blue sea When finally Thavalai looked up, he saw it down in the valley ahead. At last, finally, it lay there in front of him. The big, big blue blue sea, its little fingers snaking into the hills around. Thavalai looked at it in wonder, watching the blueness disappear into the distance and meeting the sky somewhere beyond the lands where animals lived. He hopped down towards it, never quite believing that this was not an illusion, a trick of the the wind and the fog and the sun.And when finally he did reach it, he laid a tentative toe in the water, as if it might swallow him whole. It was cool and fresh to the touch. And calm, unlike any water that Thavalai had seen before. The waters in the streams rushed and babbled, and argued and whined, and behaved like juvenile delinquents or raging adults. This quiet wisdom of water he had not seen before.The bigger sea Tree frogs were happy with the little pools that collected in tree boles and tree holes. And compared to a little saucepan of water in the crevice between two crooked branches, this expanse of water was like the universe itself. “Where are you going now?” Ahaetulla asked.“I don’t know,” said Thavalai, “I came to see the sea, and now that I have, maybe I’ll go home.” “But there is so much else to see,” said Ahaetulla, whose forefathers had come up the hill from the west. “This is just a lake, and there is a much bigger sea, at the bottom of mountains, where the sun sets.” “A bigger sea?” cried Thavalai. “How can that even be?”Up the western catchment Up the hill they went, Ahaetulla winding his way up the sinuous path, Thavalai but a few hops behind. They went past a little shola nestled in the cup of the hill’s palm. The cinnamon beckoned him, the familiar smells, the warmth, the wetness. The shola is like a sponge, absorbing the torrents of rain, storing it in every crack, crevice and keyhole, absorbing it into its bark, its mud, its rock, and leaking it out bit by bit, through the little streams that rush out. And then he stopped, because there was a rock in front of him. But it was soft, warm, steaming almost and smelled very strange. “Elephants,” Ahaetulla said. “Is this an elephant?” he asked, thinking it was not as impressive as he thought it may have been. “No, silly, that’s just their poop. Elephants are a thousand times your size. Maybe a zillion.” “But how do they get up here?” “Elephants can go anywhere,” Ahaetulla said mysteriously and went on.To the top of the mountain And then it started to rain. The water came down in buckets, till there were rivulets flowing through the grassland. It can rain for months, yelled Ahaetulla, through the rain. I know, cried Thavalai, in reply. He loved the rain. But the going was getting difficult and slippery. Thavalai could manage on any tree, but the mud and the grass was very uncomfortable. After what seemed like a very long time, they came up to the top. It was covered by a deep fog, and Thavalai sighed. This looked like another wild goose chase. But then the mist cleared.An amphitheatre for the amphibian Everything that Thavalai had seen so far  the tree, the sea, the kurinji flowers  it all paled in comparison. The fog lifted over the grandest stage of all. Three cliffs surrounded the peak that Thavalai and Ahaetulla sat on. “An amphitheatre for the amphibian,” Ahaetulla muttered. Each cliff plunged thousands of feet to land below, sweeping down into a plateau to the south and undulating lush hills to the north, towards bigger, larger peaks.Kestrels wheeled around screaming. The west glowed orange as the sun set, bathing the entire landscape with a soothing light. As evening gave way to twilight, and twilight to darkness, they stayed there on the ridge, watching the west. A small glimmer of light from very, very far caught their eye. Somewhere near the lights, Ahaetulla said, is the sea. And it goes on forever and ever until the end of the world.Heads down the hill to the silent valley Thavalai made up his mind to go on to the big sea, but Ahaetulla would go no further. He pointed him to the Silent Valley. Thavalai wondered why it had been given this name. But after he had been in it for a while, he began to realize why. It was quiet as a tomb. And the trees were tall, unlike in the sholas above. And the lower he descended, the taller they became.This was a magical land. With hornbills, frogmouths, and owls. Strange birds and stranger animals. Sometimes, the forest echoed with the hoots of langurs and the calls of liontailed macaques. In the evening, the forest filled with calls and shrieks and squeaks.Some new froggy friends High above in the canopy, Thavalai could hear the sounds of the birds, ones that he had seen flying around the Big Tree at home. He saw many frogs like Nycti, the torrent frog, who loved the waterwashed rocks as their home. They clung to the wet surface as the rapids splashed and smashed against the rocks, and called from the cracks and laid their eggs on the wet leaves that overhung the streams. At this time, he heard the strangest sound that he had ever heard. It seemed to come from deep within the earth. But that could not be. It sounded so like a frog, and yet not like a frog.The balloon frog incident Then he saw it lumbering towards him, the strangest animal he had ever seen. It seemed quite amorphous and shapeless, purple like rich humus earth. It seemed to flow forward, rather than walk or jump, almost as if it was the mud itself come to life in a strange frog form. Apart from its pointy pig snout, Thavalai could make out no other feature. From the safety of his root haven, Thavalai called out to the creature. Alarmed, it swelled up like a balloon, and looked around with its beady eyes. “Who are you?” Thavalai ventured. Looking at him carefully, the ancient creature answered, “I am the oldest frog of the forest. My ancestors came here long before anyone else. They call me Nasika. I live deep inside the earth most of the time.” “It must be lonely down there, and dark and scary,” said Thavalai. Nasika smiled, as much as her narrow mouth would allow. “It’s a busy world down there,” she said. “There are earthworms, and bugs and beetles, and spiders, and cockroaches, and scorpions. And even snakes.”“Snakes?” said Thavalai in astonishment. “Yes, beautiful shiny snakes with a little shield on their tail that they use to dig. But where do you live, little one?” “Oh, I live up in the tree,” Thavalai said, “up on the mountain.” “You can climb trees!” said Nasika with astonishment now.Flying frogs, lizards and snakes Thavalai decided to climb up a tree to get a breath of fresh sky and plan his next hop, step and jump. He climbed till he reached the canopy. A cloud overhung the valley, little wisps of smoke lingering over the treetops, little rings of cloud hanging like halos over wizened trees. Thavalai’s reverie was interrupted by streaks of colour flying by. Thavalai thought these were more birds, but all of a sudden, a frog landed next to him.A flying frog, he marveled. “I’m Rhaco,” said the flying frog. Soon, Rhaco’s friend, Draco, the flying lizard and Chrysopelea, the flying snake came gliding down to join them, and they engaged in a frenzy of jumping and gliding.The slightly and very venomous snakes Thavalai also met Bamboo Pambu, the slightly venomous snake. Later, he saw a young ratsnake, all bronze and glistening in the rays of sunlight that sneaked through the foliage and survived the maze of leaves. Suddenly, a large pair of jaws closed around the head of the ratsnake and swallowed him whole. It was Hannah, the extremely venomous snake. The snake who ate other snakes. Thavalai looked at her in awe and amazement. Hannah was a striking yellow and black, that went on and on, as far as his eyes could see. He wondered if he should try and follow the path to the end of the snake. But there seemed to be no end to the snake called Hannah!The philosophy of Rana Thavalai wondered how much further he would need to go. At the edge of the forest, everything looked very strange  barren, noisy, peopled. At the edge of a field, he met an even larger frog than Bufo. But he had a really pleasant disposition. “You can call me Rana,” he said, giving him a hug (and rubbing his belly), “though its not my real name. My real name is much longer and you would have trouble pronouncing it.”Rana told him that the sea was far away, and the path held too many dangers. And too few trees. Where once there was forest, there was now field, or city. The real sea was not friendly to frogs, nor was the path to it. “Little seas at home are as grand as big seas in other worlds,” he said. Rana told him that maybe it was time for him to go home after all his adventures.Thavalai goes home Thavalai had learnt that the world was a strange and dangerous place. He did not like the fast torrents that Nycti lived in, nor could he live under the soil like Nasika. He liked the top of trees. On the tops of mountains. And now it was time to return there. Philautus Frog did not go around the world. But he went as far as any tree frog from the Big Tree had ever gone in a very long time. Thavalai, the tree frog turned towards the hills and set off again to go back to his friends and family on the Big Tree.Information The Western Ghats: The Western Ghats are a long chain of mountains running along the west coast of India from the southern tip of the peninsula to the River Tapti in Maharashtra. Sholas and grasslands: In the southern Western Ghats, the tops of the mountains have a unique habitat which consists of undulating plains of grasslands, with small patches of evergreen forests with stunted trees, known as sholas. Frogs and toads: A toad is actually a kind of frog. Toads generally have a dry and warty skin. They tend to be more terrestrial than most other frogs, but usually lay their eggs in the water. Scientific names: Plants and animals are known by scientific names which consist of a genus and species (Eg. Homo sapiens for humans). Scientific names sometimes change on the basis of new discoveries about taxonomy and evolution.Cast of Characters (in order of appearance) Philautus: Philautus are a group of tree frogs or bush frogs found in India, Sri Lanka and South East Asia. Unlike other frogs, most species belonging to this group lay eggs that undergo direct development. That is, they bypass the tadpole stage and little froglets hop out of the eggs! Most bush frogs of the Western Ghats now belong to the genus Raorchestes. Bufo: Bufo is a genus of toads. The common toad in India was long known by the scientific name, Bufo melanostictus; it is now called Duttaphrynus melanostictus. Sally A: Salea are agamid lizards, part of the same family as the garden lizards, Calotes. Ahaetulla: Ahaetulla is a genus of grass snakes. The common vine snake, which is found all over India, is also a species that belongs to the genus Ahaetulla.Nasika: The frog, Nasikabatracus sahyadrensis, was discovered only a few years ago. It is believed to be one of the oldest frogs in India, which means it has remained relatively unchanged for over  million years. Its closest relatives live in Seychelles. Nycti: Nyctibatrachus are torrent frogs which live in fastflowing streams in the Western Ghats. Rhaco: Rhacophorus are also tree frogs, and some are known for their gliding ability; they build foam nests attached to leaves hanging over water bodies. Draco: Draco is a lizard and Chrysopelea is a snake, both known for their gliding ability. Hannah: The king cobra, or Ophiophagus hannah, is the world’s longest venomous snake and feeds exclusively on other snakes. Bamboo Pambu: This refers to the common and mildly venomous bamboo pit viper. Rana: Rana is a genus of frogs, now known by several different names. The bull frog, once called Rana tigerina, is now called Hoplobatrachus tigerinus. It is the largest frog in India.	./Story text files/170.txt	17690	19	6.040299366724237	1350	387	229	70.04819277108433	89	160	43	13.726907630522089	70	179	959	778	6	1.5494335736354274	1638	304
Avanti was the zookeeper of Pitara zoo. There were many, many animals in Pitara, but Avanti's best friend was Ballu, the bear. Ballu was big, brown and strong. On his fourth birthday, Avanti organised a little party for Ballu.“Ballu, can you blow out all the candles at once?” Avanti asked. “Of course!” said Ballu. He filled his chest with air. He huffed and puffed and puffed and huffed and went “WHOOSH!”The blast of air blew the candles out. Then rising up, it crashed into the clouds in the sky. And all of a sudden, there was was a roar of thunder and it started to rain.“Hey, it’s raining fish,” Avanti shouted. Ballu looked around with wonder. Then he picked up a huge basket and ran around collecting fish as they fell from the sky. Every time the basket filled, he dropped the fish in a little pond and ran back for more.Then, as he was rushing for the tenth time to the pond, he turned back. The water level had risen and he could see that Avanti was scared.Ballu came back quickly, picked Avanti up and placed her on his shoulders. Avanti put her arms around Ballu's neck and thanked him. Soon, the clouds disappeared and the sun came out. It was bright and cheerful once again.“I will never again ask you to blow the candles out,” said Avanti. “Why?” asked Ballu. “Who knows? Next time it might start raining frogs,” Avanti said and the two friends started laughing.	./Story text files/270.txt	1379	13	5.755102040816326	129	18	90	46.58620689655172	15	14	19	9.551724137931034	14	15	90	57	4	1.4437869822485208	151	18

Dinner for the sparrowsThere is nothing left in the tiffin box…. . . until tomorrow!A note on feeding neighbourhood animals If you decide to share food with the animals who live near your home, you need to think about some things.  Ask yourself if you can feed animals over a long stretch of time.  Choose an open space away from other people’s homes. Try to feed them at the same time every day.  Feeding just once a day will help street animals keep the ability to hunt for their own food.  If you are going to take care of animals, make sure that they are healthy. Call the local animal hospital to give them vaccinations . Some animals and birds such as pigeons, monkeys, or mice can become pests because of feeding, so do not feed them!  Water is just as important as food, especially in the summer! A clay pot will help keep the water cool.  Avoid oily, salty, sweet or spicy foods.

In Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan, there is a mountain called Ban Pin Shan, meaning ‘one half’. Strange name for an ordinary mountain, you might think. But take one look at it and you will see why it is called so. It looks like one half of the mountain is missing! Almost as if someone has cut off the top neatly, with a big sword. Before you start to wonder how it got its name, let me tell you the legend behind it. Long, long ago, when Ban Pin Shan was still a whole mountain, there used to be a village near it. One day, a very old man came to the village carrying a huge pot on his head. His hair was white as snow, and so was his beard. His face was wrinkled like the old, wornout clothes he wore. He set the pot down in the village square and opened the lid.The sweet smell of fresh dumplings filled the air. “Hot dumplings! Fresh, hot dumplings!” he yelled. “One for one cent, two for two cents and three, for FREE!” Villagers passing by became curious and crowded around this foolish man who was giving away dumplings that looked inviting and smelt absolutely delicious. “One for one cent, two for two cents and three, for FREE!” yelled the old man again. “Red beans and sesame, and three for free.” The villagers who had gathered around the old man began whispering to each other. “Must be a trick! Three dumplings for free? How can that be?” they said.“The most delicious ones, Sir,” said the old man as he handed the first one to BigHead Wang. It was as big as an egg. BigHead Wang popped it into his mouth and went mmmm…. Everyone could see that he was really enjoying the dumpling. By the time he finished the second one, his stomach was full. But he looked at the old man and said, “If I eat the third one, I don’t have to pay. It is not a lie, right?” He wanted to make sure the old man had meant what he said. “Three for free and that it will be!” said the old man, handing BigHead Wang the third dumpling, which he promptly stuffed into his mouth. If he could eat it, he wouldn’t have to pay anything.The old man kept his word and BigHead Wang went away happy, his stomach full to bursting. Soon, everyone wanted three dumplings each. Not a single villager ordered one or two dumplings; everyone wanted only three for free. In a while, the whole pot was wiped clean. Some of the villagers were disappointed as the old man prepared to leave. “My, my, don’t all of you have good appetites,” the old man said as he heaved the empty pot over his head and walked away. Suddenly, EagleEye Chan, who had just gulped down three free dumplings, cried out, “Look! A part of the mountain is missing!”“Nonsense!” said the villagers. “Too many dumplings in your tummy have made you think funny!” All of them laughed at EagleEye Chan, who kept staring at the mountain long after the villagers had left. That evening, everyone was talking about the old man and his delicious dumplings. “He must be a really stupid man to give away three for free!” they said, laughing. “Let’s hope he comes every day.” The next morning, the old man arrived again, carrying his pot of dumplings. He set the pot down again in the village square. “One for one cent, two for two cents and three, for FREE!” he yelled. “Peanuts and sesame, and three for free.”This time, the pot was emptied an hour earlier than the previous day. The villagers had eaten up all the dumplings, three apiece. And for free. Quietly, the old man heaved the pot over his head and left, smiling a strange smile. On the third day, the old man came again. This time, the villagers were waiting for the stupid old man to arrive. Soon, they were trying to eat as many dumplings as possible, for free. Suddenly, a voice said, “Mister, can I have one dumpling, please?” Everyone froze! Their mouths hung open with bits of dumpling falling out, as they tried to catch sight of whoever had uttered the words.Now, which idiot would want to pay for ONE dumpling when he could have THREE for FREE? There was pindrop silence. They saw a young man with a soft face standing in the middle of the crowd, a single cent in his outstretched hand. The old man spoke. “Young man, didn’t you hear me?” he said. “One for one cent, two for two cents and three, for FREE!” “Yes, I did,” said the young man in a sincere voice. “But I’ve seen how you’ve carried this huge pot every day, giving away your dumplings, three for free. You have not made any money in the last few days and I feel sorry for you. I want to help, but I have only enough money to pay for one dumpling.”When the villagers heard the young man, their hearts were filled with shame. They hung their heads in silence. The old man stepped towards the young man and embraced him. “Ha! At last I’ve found you!” he cried. “I am the mountain god and I choose you to be my pupil. I will teach you all the magic that I know,” he said, as tears flowed down his old, wrinkled face. The villagers quickly realized that the mountain god had disguised himself as this old man to test them. And to find a kindhearted soul who could become his pupil. Then, the mountain god revealed to the utter shock of everyone present that the dumplings they had been eating weren’t real dumplings. They were made from the mud that he had dug out from the mountain.As soon as the villagers heard this, they ran to see the leftover dumplings in the pot. But all they saw was a pot full of mud! And when they turned to look at the mountain, they couldn’t believe their eyes! There was only half of it left standing! Just as EagleEye Chan had said. But they had been too greedy to listen…. Soon, the mountain god took his young disciple with him to the mountain to teach him the magic of the gods. As for the villagers, their hearts were filled with remorse and they cursed themselves for being so greedy. They named the mountain Ban Pin Sghan – a name that stands to this day – and vowed to be less greedy. Now tell me, if an old man came to your town selling delicious dumplings, “One for one cent, two for two cents and three, for FREE!” – how many would you buy?PAPER PIZZAZZ!

It was a bright moonlit night. All the animals in Mangu's farm were sleeping. Except Tinku!“I am not sleepy, Ma,” murmured Tinku. But Ma did not hear him. She was fast asleep. He turned left, and he turned right. He lay on his tummy, and rolled on his back. But he could not sleep!So he set off into the night to see what he could find. Up in the sky, Tinku saw the moon, white and round, smiling down at him. He felt very happy. ‘Night is beautiful, ’ thought Tinku.Far away on the top of a tree, there were some tiny lights. One spot of light flew down! “I’m a firefly,” said the spot of light. “I glow in the dark!” “Will you be my friend?” asked Tinku. “Yes, I will!” said the firefly.Something flew by and hung upside down on a tree. “What is your name, bird?” asked Tinku. “I am not a bird, I am a bat. I can see during the night!” said the bat. “Will you be my friend?” asked Tinku. “Yes, I will!” said the bat.A few leaves moved in the bushes. Someone was hiding! “Who are you?” asked Tinku. “I am a fox,” said the fox. “I go strolling out at night.” “Will you be my friend?” asked Tinku. “Yes, I will!” said the fox.Two shiny eyes looked at him from a tree. “Who are you?” asked Tinku. “I’m an owl,” said the owl. “I hunt for food during the night.” “Will you be my friend?” asked Tinku. “Yes, I will!” said the owl.“CHIRRRRRP! CHIRRRRRP!” “Who is here?” Tinku asked. “I’m a cricket,” said the cricket. “I chirp when it is dark.” “Will you be my friend?” asked Tinku. “Yes, I will!” said the cricket.Tinku and his friends jumped and tossed and rolled until Tinku yawned. “I am sleepy. I have to go home now,” said Tinku. He was happy that he had many new friends. Snuggling close to Ma, he said, “Night is not a lonely place, Ma. Night is full of wonderful beings.” “Yes!” replied Ma. “Your new friends are nocturnal, just like wild dogs.”“Nocturnal animals eat, play and work at night. They rest during the day. You must sleep now. Sleep will give you energy to play with your daytime friends tomorrow. Good night, little one!” she said, hugging him tight.The bright round moon shone all night long, spreading her calm light all around. And Tinku slept all through the night!	./Story text files/274.txt	2185	17	5.479338842975206	214	28	79	27.025641025641026	70	8	16	6.256410256410256	62	16	155	87	3	1.1622516556291391	289	13

Sona’s uncle was a chuski maker. Some people call an icecandy ‘chuski’. Some people call it ‘gola’. One day, Sona went to Uncle’s house to see how he made chuski.Uncle was trying to make syrups of different colours and flavours. He was getting them ready in four huge vessels. “Uncle, let me also help you make the syrups!” said Sona.“No, no, Sona! Why don’t you just sit and watch me working?” Uncle added a colour and essence to one vessel. “Ahhhh, that smell goes straight to my throat! That is kalakhatta, right?”“You are right, Sona. That gives the chuskis a tangy taste,” said Uncle. “But I can smell something else too. Not a good smell!” said Sona.Uncle added a flavour to another vessel. Sona took a deep breath. “Ah, this is an earthysweet smell! Pomegranate chuski!”“Wow, Sona, you are right again!” said Uncle and went to another vessel. “But I can still smell something that is not nice!” said Sona, holding her nose.“Now, I am adding the rose flavour here,” said Uncle and he stirred the liquid in the third vessel. “Does it smell nice and sweet?”“Something is burning, Uncle!” shouted Sona, suddenly. “I think something is stuck to the bottom of the vessel!”Uncle looked around. The milk was boiling in one vessel. He quickly took it off the stove.“Good job, Sona!” said Uncle, as he poured the milk into another clean vessel. “You have saved the rabdi* chuski!

But Peechu's furry head is already disappearing into the water.Gurru starts crying. Every memory with Peechu flashes before his eyes.“Bhow bhow!” Peechu paddles through the water proudly carrying the ball. ""Peechu, I didn't know you could swim, "" says Gurru. ""Bhow bhow!

On a cliff there lived a young vulture with his mother.When he was old enough to fly, his mother took him high into the air and they circled together, watching the ground below. “I want to show you something beautiful,” she told her son. They saw an old gemsbok staggering through the heat. “Look there. That gemsbok won’t last long.”The two vultures flew down. “This isn’t beautiful,” said the young vulture to his mother. “This is horrible!” Sure enough, the buck collapsed right there and died.“I know,” said his mother. “Death is very difficult, and very sad. But it is also beautiful.” “No ways,” said the young vulture. “Yuck.” “Just wait,” she said. “We will come back here soon and you will see.”The next week, they visited the dead buck. Its skeleton was clean and white, and tiny plants had started to grow between the bones.The week after that, the shoots had grown tall and blossomed. A butterfly sipped at the flowers and a songololo rested in their shade.A week later, a pair of weavers was picking the leaves to build a nest. Bees were collecting pollen from the blossoms. And a spider had made her home between the buck’s horns.And the week after that, they saw a young gemsbok nibbling the tasty shoots.“Well?” said the vulture’s mother. “Look at the life one buck has given. He has given a spider a home and weavers a nest, fed bees and butterflies, sheltered a songololo, and helped the next generation of buck grow strong.” The young vulture smiled.The two of them flew back to their nest high up on the cliff.“It is not just our bodies we leave behind when we die,” said the mother vulture. “We also leave our lessons and our love and our memories.”“Where do we leave all those things?” asked the little vulture. “We leave them in our children and in our family and friends. You are already my green patch on earth, Little Vulture. And you will be, forever.”	./Story text files/10.txt	1879	16	5.936842105263158	149	41	149	47.205128205128204	21	18	28	9.512820512820513	19	20	115	75	4	1.3727272727272728	196	24
"Putta and Putti jumped out of bed. It was Muttajji's birthday and they had a train to catch!Muttajji, who was the twins' mother's mother's mother, lived in Mysore with Ajji, who was the twins' mother's mother. No one actually knew when Muttajji's birthday was; Ajji had always celebrated it on the Makara Sankranthi holiday. ""Amma, will there be a cake? "" asked Putti. ""A big, spongy cake with pink icing and a rose on top? "" ""Naah, "" said Putta. ""Old people don't have birthday cakes. And  candles won't fit on any cake. "" ""Muttajji isn't  years old, silly, "" said Putti. ""How old is Muttajji, Amma? "" Amma smiled. ""Why don't you ask her when we get there? ""The moment they reached the old green house in Mysore, the twins burst into Muttajji's room. ""Happy birthday, Muttajji! How old are you today? "" Muttajji hugged the twins. ""How old am I? Who knows? How does it matter? "" ""But it does! "" cried Putta and Putti together.Muttajji smiled. ""Well, "" she said, ""I know that around five years before I was born, our Maharaja went to a grand party for Indian Maharajas and Maharanis in Delhi. A British king and queen had come to visit, and our Maharaja got a gold medal. "" ""Oooh! A party! There must have been lots of cake! "" said Putti. ""Who was this king, Muttajji? If you know, we can find out which year he visited. if we add five years to that, we will know when YOU were born! "" Muttajji shrugged. ""I've forgotten, Putta. "" Putta's face fell.""Wait, "" said Muttajji. ""Let me see if I can remember something else. Aaaan! When I was about your age  nine or ten  my uncle from Bombay visited us and told us about clean trains. "" ""Clean trains? "" ""Yes! "" Muttajji was excited. ""They had started running in Bombay that year. You never got dirty travelling in them. No black dust on your clothes and face, no grime, nothing! "" The twins stared at her. Why would anyone get dirty travelling by train?""Some years later, "" continued Muttajji, ""I got married. The law was that a girl should be at least  before she was married, and my father would never break the law, so I must have been  then. Very soon after my marriage, your Muttajja got a job in Bombay, and we left Mysore. "" ""Did anything important happen the year you got married, Muttajji? "" asked Putta. ""Yes, "" said Muttajji sadly. ""Our Maharaja inaugurated our big dam, and the beautiful gardens next to it, during the Dasara festival that year. But I missed it; I was in Bombay. "" ""A big dam? "" Putta sat up. ""Is it still there? ""Muttajji hooted with laughter. ""Of course! Rocksolid too. It was the dam that tamed the Kaveri. No more floods in the monsoon, and enough water for the fields in the summer. "" Ajji put her head around the door. ""Are you talking about KRS, Amma? "" ""Aaaan, KRS, "" Muttajji said, looking fondly at Ajji. ""Your Ajji was my fifth child, the youngest, but always the smartest. Do you know, twins, my children came like clockwork, one every two monsoons. The day your Ajji decided to come out, your Muttajja could not be found. Later, he told us that he had gone to see Gandhiji give a speech at the Gowalia Tank Maidan. He was so excited. 'Quit India! ' he kept shouting the whole day, silly man, disturbing the baby. '""Quit India! "" Putti's eyes grew round with excitement. ""We studied it in history, Putta! The movement started in ! That means  was the year that. . . "" "". . . Ajji was born, "" pouted Putta. ""Not Muttajji. "" ""That's a start! "" said Putti. ""Which year were you born, Ajji? "" ""I will be  this year, "" said Ajji. ""So I was born in? "" Putti quickly did the calculations. ""! *"" she said. Ajji nodded. *(   = )""Now, Ajji is Muttajji's fifth child and all her kids were two years apart! "" said Putta. ""So if Ajji was born in . . . "" "". . . Muttajji's fourth child was born in    = , the third in    = , the second in    = , and the first in    = . "" ""So Muttajji was married in ! "" cried Putti. ""Not necessarily, "" said Putta. ""Muttajji didn't say her first child was born two years after her marriage. She only said a dam was built in Mysore the year she got married. """"Maybe this will help, twins, "" said Ajji, bringing in bowls of vermicelli payasa, Muttajji's favourite sweet dish. ""KRS is the Krishnarajasagar Dam. The Brindavan Gardens are the gardens attached to it. We went there last year to see the musical fountains, remember? "" The twins nodded. ""Mmmm, "" said Putti. ""Your payasa is the BEST, Ajji! "" ""When was KRS built, do you know, Ajji? "" Ajji shook her head. ""I'm not sure. But you can go with Ajja to the central library after lunch and find out there. ""In the library, Putti found a book on the history of Mysore. ""Here it is! "" she whispered. ""Two of Mysore's most visited tourist spots, the KRS Dam and the adjacent Brindavan Gardens, were opened to the public in . '"" The twins grinned  that meant Muttajji had indeed married in , * years ago! *(   = )""Muttajji thinks she was  when she got married, "" said Putti, ""but she could have been  or  or . "" ""She also said she was about  or  when her Bombay uncle told her about the 'clean' train, "" said Putta. ""Ajja may know what that means. "" Ajja was in the reading room. ""Ajja, "" whispered Putti, ""in the olden days, did people get dirty travelling by train? "" Ajja nodded. ""There were steam engines then, which ran on coal, not electricity, "" he said. ""Black coal dust used to fly out of the chimney and land on everyone and everything. Terrible! "" ""That's it, Putti! "" hissed Putta. ""Electric trains were the 'clean' trains! ""He pulled out a book on the Indian Railways. ""It says here, "" he pointed, ""that India's first electric train came to Bombay in ! "" ""And Muttajji says she was about  then, "" said Putta. ""If she is right, then Muttajji was born in *. "" ""But she could be wrong, you know, "" frowned Putti. ""Only one way to make sure, "" said Putta. ""We have to find out if that big party for kings and queens in Delhi, which Muttajji said happened five years before she was born, happened in **. "" They ran back to Ajja. *( = ); **(  = )""Ajja, was there a grand party for a foreign king who visited India around ? "" Ajja frowned. ""? Why is that date so familiar? Aaan yes. It was the year the Gateway of India was built in Bombay. And yes, it was built to welcome the British Emperor of India, George V! There must have been several grand parties, not one. "" Ajja tapped his forehead, looking very pleased with himself. ""Not bad for an old brain, eh? "" ""Not bad at all! "" cried the twins. ""Thanks, Ajja! "" They knew exactly how old Muttajji was!Five minutes later, the twins were racing homewards. ""Muttajji, "" they panted, rushing straight to her room, ""did the Mysore Maharaja get his gold medal from King George V? "" ""Aaaaaan! "" Muttajji said happily. ""That's it! George! What clever children you are! "" ""That means, Muttajji, that you were born in ! You are exactly * years old today! "" *(   = )""That's great detective work, twins! "" smiled Amma. ""I think you  and Muttajji  deserve a special treat. A big, spongy one, with pink icing, and a rose on top. "" ""Hurrayyyyyy! "" cheered the twins.The Grand MaharajaMaharani Party (and other fun stuff from Indian history) Remember all the important historical events Muttajji talked about in the story? They all really happened! Here is a little more information about them.The Grand MaharajaMaharani Party ()  When the British Emperor George V and his wife Queen Mary visited India for the first time, they hosted a grand party for over  Indian kings and queens. It was called the Delhi Durbar. To feed ,  guests, bakeries put out  loaves of bread a day, and over  cattle and sheep were slaughtered for every meal! Many Indian rulers received gold medals from the Emperor, including the Maharaja of Mysore, Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV.The Clean Trains ()  On Feb , , India's first electric train left Bombay's Victoria Terminus for Kurla station. With that, India became the rd country in Asia and only the th in the world to introduce railway electrification. The Dam That Tamed The Kaveri ()  The Kaveri river runs through southern Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The river was always a blessing, keeping Mysore fertile, but, like every other river, it used to flood in the monsoons and run dry in the summer. All that changed when a dam was built across the river and the Krishna Raja Sagara (KRS) reservoir created. The reservoir still provides most of the drinking water for Bangalore city.Gandhiji's Big Speech ()  The 'Quit India Speech' was a speech made by Gandhiji on  August , at the Gowalia Tank Maidan in Bombay. Gandhiji asked people to fight against British rule not by using violence, but by disobeying their laws. Five years later, on August , , the nonviolent war got the results Gandhiji wanted  the British left, and India became independent. Today, the Gowalia Tank Maidan is called the August Kranti Maidan in memory of that peaceful revolution."	./Story text files/51.txt	8876	17	5.198130841121495	889	181	188	45.234375	125	67	37	9.739583333333334	109	83	579	491	8	1.3325545171339563	1120	164
Kasini is eight years old. She loves to cook. She reads a cook book on the school bus every morning and before bedtime.Nobody knows her secret, that she sleeps with a wooden mingling stick every night. When she sleeps, she dreams that she is smiling, wearing a chef’s hat and holding her mingling stick high up in the air.Kasini loves to sing as she cooks. She sings to the carrots and dances with the flour.She slices the cucumber and places two on top of her eyes. She BANGS the saucepans loudly as she jumps up and down.“GET BACK TO WORK.” the stick scolds. “Cooking is not work, it’s fun,” Kasini laughs. The stick tells her if the soup needs more salt, if the chicken needs more heat and when the Ugali is ready to eat.Sometimes Kasini doesn’t listen to the stick. “I will use my palm to taste the soup,” she says.“I will use my mouth to taste the chicken,” she decides. The stick laughs for she is young and it is old. Older than the cutlery in the house, Older than Kasini’s older brother. So old it knows all the great recipes by heart.Kasini adds more salt, pepper and curry powder to the soup. This is wrong and she knows it but she is only being stubborn.The stick doesn’t like being disrespected, it changes colour from brown to red to show Kasini that it is angry.“The soup will BURN without the mingling stick!” moans Kasini.She sings for the stick, but there is no change. “I am sorry,” she says. The stick turns back to brown just in time and Kasini hugs it in joy.“Now I can serve mummy the food I made,” Kasini says excitedly. “The food we made,” she giggles, as she tucks the stick away.	./Story text files/387.txt	1606	14	5.822784810126582	134	24	120	52.56666666666667	15	15	25	10.9	10	20	93	65	4	1.3934426229508197	161	22

Choo Choo! It's midnight, and a train is traveling swiftly through the dark.

Soon she is passing fields and lakes, laughing as she goes.There's no stopping her! She chugs along through the next day, taking no rests. CLANK CLANK, the train says, smiling broadly. CLACKITY CLACK!Eventually, the train arrives in a far away land. She begins to get a little scared, slowing down as she passes strange people making strange faces. The smile fades from her face.It's night again and the train is farther than she's ever been before. She wants to rest for a while, but in this dense forest of elephants, shebegins to fear for her life.Suddenly, a nearby bush starts to shake! The train gives a terrified shout! Out pops a little boy, smiling happily.He holds a magic flute and begins to play. The sweet notes help the train feel better. As he plays his tunes, she feels herself becoming a little braver.The train dances around the boy, cheerful once again. The boy plays all through the night. The train and all the forest animals dance for hours.By the next day, the train is feeling happy once again.

We are off to see spiders, Some large as a plate, some small as a pin. We will see so many spiders, Our heads will spin, spin, spin!“Is that an ant or a spider?” asks Kaveri. It looks like an ant, but it has eight legs. “Uff, ants are insects. All insects have six legs, not eight. But you are right, this does look like an ant!” says Shivi. “Full marks,” says Shama. “It is an antmimic spider.” Kaveri and Shivi love being with Shama. She is studying to be a wildlife biologist, and is full of fun facts and stories about different animals and plants.Just then, Kaveri spots the sac spider. It's neatly rolled up inside a leaf! “How did you find it?” asks Shivi. “Ah! When you get to know the different signs that spiders make, you start finding them everywhere,” Shama says, with a wink.We are off to see spiders, Some fat, some thin, some hairy. They have eight legs and eight eyes, But don’t worry! They are not scary!“Ummm, that looks like a crab!” says Shivi, squinting at a yellow flower. “Ha!” Shama says. “It’s the crab spider. And look! It has caught a poor bee that was visiting the flower for nectar.” “Ah, no wonder the bee didn’t see the spider. It’s almost the same colour as the flower,” says Kaveri.“Look, look,” yells Shivi, pointing towards the leaves on the damp ground. A female wolf spider is carrying her egg sac. “And there is another one! Ooh! There are hundreds of tiny baby spiders on her back!” Shama whispers in awe.We are off to see spiders, Oh where, oh where, oh where? On grass, on leaves, on flowers, Here, there and everywhere!Shivi is leaning on a tree trunk when suddenly he jumps in fright! Something scuttled by at lightning speed. “There you are!” Shama says, moving closer. “See how well the twotailed spider blends with the tree bark?”“Here’s a spider that looks like it has only four legs,” Kaveri says excitedly, pointing towards a bush. The spider has spun a wheelshaped web between two plants. “What a beautiful zigzag pattern! This has to be the cross spider,” Shama exclaims.We are off to see spiders, So far we have had quite a catch! Hey! Someone’s spinning lovely webs, On this grassy patch.Kaveri, Shivi and Shama stumble upon a sheetandtunnel web spider. “So many webs,” Kaveri exclaims. “They look like delicate sheets!” “This juicy grasshopper stuck in the web will become spider food soon. Slurp!” says Shivi.“Right! It’s time to go home now,” says Shama, looking at her watch. “I have to study for my class tomorrow.” Kaveri and Shivi’s faces fall. “Oh don't worry, there’s plenty to see at home as well,” says Shama.Back home, Shama spies the common house spider. “Oh! There’s the daddylonglegs spider.” “They are funny,” says Kaveri. “They dangle upside down and have long, long legs.”We saw so many wondrous spiders, On grass, trees and flower heads.Let’s crawl and look for more of them, Will we find some under our beds?Spider Guide Meet the spiders that Kaveri, Shivi and Shama see on their walk. Twotailed spiders These spiders get their name because of their long spinning organs that look like a tail! With a flat body, these spiders blend in very well on tree trunks and walls. Antmimic spiders They behave just like ants and look like them too! These spiders in disguise trick animals and birds that like to eat spiders.Crab spiders With a much longer and stronger pair of front legs, these spiders often extend their legs while waiting to catch their food. This pose makes them look very much like a crab! Wolf spiders You will often find wolf spiders scuttling on the ground, especially where there are leaves and shrubs. A female wolf spider carries egg sacs attached to her spinning organs. When the sac opens, hundreds of baby spiders climb onto her back and stay there for several days.Sac spiders These spiders rest inside silken sacs that they make within rolled leaves and blades of grass. They come out of their silken retreats when they have to hunt for food. Sheetandtunnel web spiders These spiders make beautiful and delicate sheet like webs. A tunnel at the end of the sheet web is the perfect hiding place for them. They dart out when an insect gets caught in the web.Daddylonglegs spiders These common house spiders are found on the ceiling, in corners of houses and sheds. Their cobwebs may look untidy, but they catch a lot of flying insect pests. Cross spiders When cross spiders are on their wheelshaped webs, they look like they’re making an Xshape! They are also called signature spiders because of the zigzag pattern they make on their webs.	./Story text files/432.txt	4533	17	5.79835390946502	406	80	136	49.943820224719104	46	43	24	9.92134831460674	39	50	292	194	5	1.3964601769911504	520	45

I wonder if there's another me somewhere in the world.Who looks the same.And talks the same.And even has my curls.Someone with my eyes my ears.Who even has my laugh.Who can do what I can do.And can't do what I can't.I've looked and looked everywhere to find another me. I went down to the park and looked behind the trees.I looked around, up and down.At every single face.I couldn't find another me in any single place.There's only one me in the world! I'm special, oh it's true!But not just me, don't you see? There's only one of you!	./Story text files/361.txt	535	13	6.16	38	12	53	28.77777777777778	15	3	12	6.333333333333333	14	4	32	18	4	1.4509803921568627	45	6
Anu loves to look at things, big things and small. Houses on hills, ants on a wall.Things in the kitchen, things on the shelf. Things in the garden, things on herself.Anu sees patterns and shapes everywhere, nothing at all can escape her stare!Spots on a ladybird, circles in trees, shapes made by people, shapes made by bees.Lines on a leaf, just like lines on her hand. The marks of her feet in wet seaside sand.Waves in the water, waves in her hair. Mushrooms on tree trunks, birds in the air.Words in a book that can take her to places, full of new colours, new stories, new faces.Things of the colour that she loves best  RED! The three wiggly hairs on her brother Boo's head.Sprinkles on the cake Daddy baked today, like the stars that twinkle at her from far away.Rabbits in clouds floating up in the sky. Elephants in shadows  come, give it a try!Anu is happy with the things that she sees. Do you also see what little Anu sees?	./Story text files/480.txt	936	14	6.0	78	18	89	48.31578947368421	15	4	18	10.052631578947368	6	13	61	35	5	1.3478260869565217	112	3

It was the final round of hideandseek. The children were so involved in the game, they did not even realize that they had crossed the old lane. Now they were in Badshahi Park.This park was royal only in name. It had no pomp and even lacked the greenery of a park. The only plants was the kneehigh grass which had not been taken care of since long. Once upon a time, there must have been flowering plants which had withered waiting for water after the last tap broke. The swings were so wobbly that they had been wrapped around their posts. The slide was in such a state that the ladder had only two steps remaining, and the metal had so many holes that if your clothes got caught, you would only leave with bloody cuts. And the merrygoround… so rusty that it rarely spun, and if you managed to make it turn, it made such a racket that the children would get scared and hop off. So, Badshahi Park did not give children much joy. It was useful only for scaring them. If a child ever demanded to go out with his Papa, Papa cleverly said, “All right, let’s go to Badshahi Park.” The child would lose his enthusiasm instantly. The only special feature in Badshahi Park was the small tomb in its centre. The tomb was in ruins, and none of its walls was in good condition.In spite of this, the children of the neighbourhood would come in the evening to play in the park. There was no one there to stop them or scold them. The dome, verandah and staircase were all covered in pigeons' droppings, as if the birds disliked the colours of the tomb and had decided to paint it differently. Inside the tomb was a long grave which had worn out over time and now looked like a crouching hunchback.It is said that the king who lay in that grave was very cruel. Reading and writing was forbidden in his kingdom. He thought that if his people were educated they would overthrow him. This is why his kingdom had neither schools nor libraries. If books were found in any home, it was burnt down. In that kingdom lived a wise man who was known around the world. People came from far and wide to listen to him speak.The evil king could not stand the wise man, but he could not dare to harm him. The man was loved by many. The king waited for an opportunity and finally, one day he hung the wise man on a false charge of theft. The wise man was hanged on a full moon night. It is said that even after killing the wise man, the king was not content. He developed phantom pains in his neck, and he would often clutch at his throat for no apparent reason.On full moon nights, his lunacy would take another hue. He used to take any rope he saw and make a noose around his neck. It took a lot of policing by the guards to save his life. One day, they were not around and the king took his own life. It was a full moon night.People say that the king did not find peace even after death. His madness continued in the grave. On full moon nights, the king rises from his grave and roams around his tomb. If anyone walks by, the ghost shouts, “I want a rope, I want a rope!” Usually the unfortunate traveller faints and falls to the ground. This is why people mostly stay away from Badshahi Park. It was dusk and the children were creating a ruckus in the park. It was Zulfi’s turn to be the den. He covered both eyes with his palms and loudly counted. . . one… two… three… Behind him the other children ran around finding spots to hide. … six… seven… eight… Soon the children had hidden in different places. Only Ashhar had not found a corner yet. . . . nine…Ashhar had only one option left–the tomb. … ten! As Zulfi finished counting, Ashhar leapt. Straight into the tomb! But Zulfi had seen him jump. He yelled from where he stood, “No Ashhar! Not there!”Zulfi's voice was filled with such fear that Ashhar could not stay there. He emerged immediately and looked at Zulfi with surprise. “What happened? Why did you yell?”“You shouldn’t hide in the tomb.” “Why, what’s over there?” “There’s a grave! A king’s grave.” “So what?” “Don’t you know what happens on full moon nights?” Hearing this, Ashhar started laughing. Zulfi did not understand what was so funny. His face fell. Seeing his expression, Ashhar laughed even harder. He called all the children. “Pinky. . . Kaasni… Sheela… Dharma… Badkoo…come out. Who wants to play with this scaredycat? Come here now!”The children did not know what the matter was. They all came running out. “Oh! Why are you two fighting?” they asked. “Who will play with him!” Ashhar pointed at Zulfi and burst into laughter again. “Why, what happened?” Kaasni came forward. “He says not to go into the tomb. He says someone will grab me.” “Well, Zulfi is right!” said Kaasni. Her support lifted Zulfi’s spirits a little. “You don’t know what is over there?” Sheela asked, taking Zulfi’s side.“Arrey, if Ashhar wants to hide there, let him. Why are you getting bothered?” Badkoo intervened. “If he hides in the tomb someone else will have to go find him. Who will enter the tomb. . . near the grave?” said Sheela. Before anybody could answer, Ashhar exploded, “You are all scaredycats… like little mice. I don’t want to play with you.”None of the children liked being yelled at in this way. Zulfi saw that most of his friends were on his side and his confidence grew. He locked eyes with Ashhar and said, “You think you’re so brave?” “I don't just think so. I am brave,” Ashhar retorted. “Can you go into the tomb at night?” “Of course, I can.” “Even on a full moon night?” “Even on a full moon night!” “Even till the headstone of the grave?” “Yes, even till the headstone of the grave!”“Then it is decided that on the next full moon night you will go into the tomb and come out after hammering a nail into the headstone of the grave.” “I accept, go on.” “If you win, we will give you a ball and a cricket bat. And if you lose?” “That will never happen, so there is no need to think about it,” Ashhar bragged. Everyone knew that he was very boastful, so they kept quiet. The problem now was finding out which night would be a full moon night.Kaasni gestured at the sky. Everyone’s eyes turned upwards. There, a roundfaced moon was smiling. Tonight was the night!“Okay! Tonight it is,” Ashhar said with confidence. “But who will bring the hammer and nail?” “I will get it.” Zulfi was not going to let this opportunity slip through his fingers. “All right, lets meet at night…over here…at ten o’ clock sharp!” Ashhar tramped through the grass and went home. The other children returned too. At ten o’ clock that night, the moon was shining as if someone had stuck a silvery bindi on the forehead of the blue sky. Ashhar kept checking the clock. His patience was just about to break when the clock struck ten. He peeped into the drawing room. Everyone had gone to their rooms. Only his brother was sitting in front of the TV, and he was so absorbed in watching ‘Comedy Circus’ that he did not even register what was happening behind his back.Ashhar quietly shut the door to his room and tiptoed outside. As soon as he crossed the front door, he sprinted towards Badshahi Park. Zulfi was waiting at the broken gate of the park. Ashhar looked around as he caught his breath. There was not another soul in the park or even outside it. “Did you bring the nail?” Ashhar panted. Zulfi handed over the nail carefully. “And the hammer?” The hammer, wrapped in newspaper, was in front of him too. “Now you wait here. I will be back in the blink of an eye,” said Ashhar, dumping the newspaper on the ground. Holding the nail in one hand and the hammer in the other, Ashhar entered the gate. The long grass inside was bathed in the moon’s silvery sheen. The swings, merrygoround and slide were all bathed in moonlight. Everything looked strange, like it had come from another world, a fairy land.Ashhar looked at the tomb and was shocked. The dome was present, but the building's foundation had disappeared. It looked as if the whole tomb was floating in the air. Ashhar stopped short. He blinked a few times and looked the tomb over, then laughed at himself. The foundation was still there. It was a trick of the moonlight. It was lighting different corners of the building differently. Ashhar took a step forward…Now he was near the tomb. The moonlight filtered through the grills of the small windows and fell in rays on the grave. The tomb was silvery too. As Ashhar took a step in the verandah, he felt as if the grave was turning. He began trembling from head to toe. He tried to gather his courage and take another step. But what was this… his other foot was frozen in place. It remained stuck to the ground. When he pulled his leg. . . thwack! His slipper broke. He felt that now misfortune was really about to fall on him. He should not have taken on this challenge.For a second this thought crossed his mind but he quickly pushed it away and picked up his broken slipper. It was covered in sticky droppings and he threw away both his slippers in irritation and went up to the verandah. When he peered in he felt as if the grave had turned again. He felt real fear in the pit of his stomach. He rubbed his eyes and began to sputter. After gathering his wits, he opened his eyes…inside the grave lay unmoving, the same as before. It had not turned left or right. His heart thudded loudly. He was not the same Ashhar his friends knew. ‘This silly bet…’ once again the same thought. He glanced once at the hammer and nail in his hands and moved forward swiftly. Reaching the tomb, he looked in every corner of the room. Patches and pockets of moonlight were scattered all over. He looked at the roof… Arrey, what is this?A huge black cloud was hovering near the ceiling. As soon as Ashhar’s gaze fell on it, the mass moved towards him with the speed of a missile. One… two. . . three… the cloud changed into many large spots in the air. Before Ashhar could react, his head received many slaps as the bats descended on him. He fell down at the head of the grave… and the bats hung from the other side of the ceiling. Ashhar was terrified now.'If I lose a moment now. . . ' Instead of finishing the thought, Ashhar held the nail at the head of the grave and struck it with the hammer. His hand was shaking, and so the hammer did not hit the nail properly. He tried once more… thak! The sound was so loud that he was startled…the nail was in the ground. Ashhar was relieved. He jumped to his feet but he could not get up. 'Dham'. . . he fell on the floor as if someone had pulled the back of his shirt. He tried harder, but he was pulled down again so hard that he hit his head. Gathering his remaining strength, he tried to get up again but was dragged to the floor. 'Is the tomb pulling me? ' he thought when suddenly his hands and feet went cold. The tomb began spinning around. The walls closed in on Ashhar…faster… and faster… Before fainting he heard a voice whispering, “Rope! I want a rope.” He did not remember anything after that point.When Ashhar opened his eyes he found himself back home. The house was full of people. Everyone was staring at him. Seeing his eyelids move, Zulfi touched his forehead and said, “Nothing happened yaar! You had only nailed your shirt to the ground…in the tomb. . . maybe you got scared!” Everyone burst out laughing and Ashhar closed his eyes, deeply embarrassed.“Look, this is for you,” said Zulfi. Ashhar opened his eyes and saw a brand new bat in Zulfi’s hands. Ashhar looked at him in surprise. “We all knew that you would go there and win the bet, too. So what if a few things did not go as planned? Here, take this bat.” Ashhar closed his eyes again… but this time, to thank his friends!	./Story text files/338.txt	11626	18	5.705479452054795	963	205	179	46.264227642276424	144	102	36	9.760162601626016	119	127	677	491	5	1.3321087435709038	1230	131

"Once there was a squirrel. A very naughty, lively little squirrel named Chulbul. Up a tree in a blink and down before you could wink! Sometimes she would stand on her two little legs, sometimes she would chase birds.One day Chulbul was sitting on the branch of a tree, munching walnuts. Suddenly her gaze fell upon her tail. “Huh!” muttered Chulbul to herself. “What good is a tail like this? So light that you can’t even feel it is there!”""Hmm. . . now, what can be done. . . "" wondered Chulbul. Chulbul pondered over her problem for a long time till she came up with an idea. Why not go to Dr. Bombo, the bear! So off went Chulbul to the hospital, where Dr. Bombo worked.In the hospital was a cupboard where tails, legs and ears of different animals were kept. ‘I shall look for a suitable tail for myself while I wait for Dr. Bombo, ’ thought Chulbul and began to examine them. After a long time, she chose the tail of a monkey.As soon as Dr. Bombo arrived, Chulbul came to his table. “Please, Dr. Bombo, could you fix this monkey’s tail on me?” she asked. Dr. Bombo peered at her over his glasses and asked, “What on earth for? What’s the matter with your tail?”“I want to change my tail,” insisted Chulbul. “I do not think a monkey’s tail is suitable for you,” advised Dr. Bombo. “No, no! That can’t be! I will not hear of it. You MUST change my tail,” Chulbul said stubbornly.“Alright. As you wish. I shall change your tail but…” Dr. Bombo replied, pushing his glasses further up on his nose. Chulbul was delighted. Dr. Bombo removed her tail and fixed the monkey’s tail on her instead.“Now that’s what I call a real tail,” said Chulbul as she pranced about gleefully. Now I can also sit on branches high up, with my tail hanging down like the monkeys.” Delighted with the idea, Chulbul left the hospital.But… “Oh dear! What is this? I can hardly walk, and why does my body feel so heavy?”Chulbul was really worried. With great difficulty she managed to walk out of the door. She was finding it difficult to walk with her heavy tail. Somehow, by pulling and dragging it along, she reached a tree. ‘I think I’ll go up the tree and rest a while, ’ thought Chulbul and tried to climb up. But now what? She couldn’t even climb an inch. Each time she tried, she fell. At last, she sat down exhausted.“No way. This tail is not right. I shall have to change it,” said Chulbul to herself and tried to pick up her long tail with her hand.Thus, staggering along, she reached Dr. Bombo’s hospital once more. “Please Doctor, this tail is far too heavy for me. Could you a fix a lighter one?” Chulbul asked in a tired voice.“ I told you so,” Dr. Bombo scolded Chulbul. “I am sorry, Dr. Bombo. You can fix a cat’s tail on me this time,” suggested Chulbul.Dr. Bombo removed the heavy tail and attached a cat’s tail in its place. “Well, at least this is lighter than the earlier one,” thought Chulbul. The change of tails had tired her out, so she simply lay down behind a tree to rest.She was so tired that she soon fell asleep. Suddenly a loud noise woke her up. “Oh my God! That dog thinks I am a cat and he’s coming for me!” yelled Chulbul and ran for her life.The dog came after her as Chulbul raced ahead. “Oh no! I can’t even run with this tail. My own dear tail was so light. I could run so well with it,” Chulbul repented.Stumbling and falling, she managed to reach Dr. Bombo’s hospital yet again. “Help! Dr. Bombo! Help!” cried Chulbul and ran inside. The dog stood outside but kept on barking. “What is it now?” asked Dr. Bombo.“That horrible dog is after me. Please, Dr. Bombo, just give me back my own tail. I don’t want anybody’s tail, just mine,” said Chulbul, shaking her head vigorously. “So now you’ve come to your senses!” smiled Dr. Bombo. Cheerfully he removed the cat’s tail and fixed Chulbul’s very own tail back on the naughty little squirrel. Heaving a sigh of relief and without a care in the world, Chulbul now walked home happily with a song on her lips:“My tail is the best So furry and light! I can scamper all day And dance through the night!”"	./Story text files/290.txt	4064	20	5.537078651685393	371	74	154	35.294642857142854	79	33	32	7.741071428571429	71	41	268	177	4	1.2612781954887218	492	40

Introducing Philautus, the tree frog Philautus, or Thavalai, as he was known to some friends, had not come down from the Big Tree his whole life. But then, neither had his father. Or mother. Or grandparents. Or great grandparents. Before that, who knew? They had lived there on the Big Tree for as long as anyone could remember. He had been born on the Big Tree, in a small nook, and splashed around as a little froglet in the tiny puddles of water that collected in the tree holes. As had his father before him.Sometimes the other frogs made fun of him, because he had never been a tadpole. ‘You were not a tadpole’ they chanted. But Thavalai was a tree frog and proud of it. The Big Tree was in the middle of a shola forest, a dark, deep and wet forest, dripping with dew, dank with mildew.Cosy sholas and harsh grasslands The shola nestled snugly at the bottom of a valley and was surrounded by undulating hills of grassland. Little fingers of shola forest snaked up the hillslope where rainfed streams had cut their courses. And as much as the seasons raged out in the grassland, inside the shola it was always cool. The grassland is a harsh land, Thavalai’s father used to say. It’s sizzling hot in the day and freezing cold at night. But here in the shola, it’s always cool and moist. That’s why you must always stay here.Thavalai and his friends, discussing their world Thavalai had heard all these names, but he had no idea what these places were. Bhavani, Bangitappal, Sispara, Nadugani, Maduppumalai shola, the shola of folds, and so on. But he had a few friends who had been around a bit. Warbler flew down from the Himalayas each year and had a bird’seye view of the whole of the Western Ghats. Of which the Nilgiris was a tiny part. Of which Mukurthi was a section. Of which Sispara was a slice. In which the tree stood.Thavalai decides to explore the world When Thavalai heard about the big blue sea from his friends, he knew he had to see it. His frog friends scoffed. Warbler said it was minuscule compared to the seas that she had seen while migrating south in winter. But Thavalai was determined to go. And one morning, he came down the Big Tree, hopping from branch to branch. He crawled down slowly, toepads gripping the bark till he reached the ground. The soil was moist and covered with dead leaves. A shrew scurried past. Around him, slugs and grubs crawled. Thavalai was tempted to climb straight back up the Big Tree to the safety of his home. Instead he hopped towards the edge of the shola.Out in the open As he got closer to the light, Thavalai’s heart beat faster and faster. What would he find? Was it the end of the world? Or was there an endless supply of food? In other words, frog heaven? When he got there finally, it was three parts fog and one part frog. A heavy, clammy mist lay over the grassland, and Thavalai could not see anything. And far away, he heard croaking. Slowly, he stepped out on to the grassland for the very first time. The cold surprised him. It was all around, the chill in the wind, the frost on the ground. And instead of a cosy cover of leaf litter, there was nothing but the crackling fronds of grasses. Briefly the fog cleared and Thavalai saw the most amazing sight. The entire hill opposite was blue. It was covered with a carpet of kurinji, the little shrub which flowered only once in twelve years. And on the edges of the shola were the sturdy rhododendron with their shocking red flowers.Encounter with Bufo As Thavalai hopped down the hill, he could hear the rushing of water. Within minutes, he came upon a little mountain stream, winding its way down a small hill, decorated with little rocks. And in one of the rocky corners was the biggest frog that Thavalai had ever seen. Bufo, fat and prosperous, was sitting at the edge of the cold and rocky stream. He looked smug and satisfied with himself. A long cluster of eggs floated in the water, that would soon become little Bufo tadpoles. Bufo and his relatives were found throughout the country. Field, forest or city, you could find Bufo.“Oh, Giant Frog, do you live in this bog?” asked Thavalai. “I am a toad, you little runt,” Bufo answered pompously, “I live everywhere.”Sally A, the grassland lizard Sally A was at home in the grassland. Like her relative, the garden lizard, Sally could change colours when she wanted. When Thavalai landed next to her, she turned a greenbrown and merged with the grass behind her. After a few minutes, she assured herself that this tiny frog posed no threat, and reappeared.“Hi there, I’m Thavalai the tree frog and I’m looking for the big blue sea,” Thavalai said. “Let me show you,” said Sally A eagerly and scooted to the top of the hill, Thavalai hopping as fast as he could behind her. “Go down that hill, and up the next one, and down again, and along the river and over the little hill and you will find the sea,” said she.Ahaetulla, the grassland snake Thavalai hopped rapidly down a little path towards the valley they called Bangitappal. He fell through the grass, slid down the rock, skated on the moss, till he was in the middle of the valley. Surrounded by hills and fog, Thavalai felt very lonely. And suddenly he was eye to eye with a creature that frogs fear the most. Inches away, the long slits of pupils and flickering tongue of a snake looked straight into Thavalai’s eyes. Thavalai was transfixed with fear. But Ahaetulla, the grass snake, had had a very fulfilling day. He had just eaten a toad and was done for the week. Languidly, he slithered up to Thavalai and asked how he might help.Thavalai explained his quest and was rewarded with a flicker of the tongue. Ahaetulla asked Thavalai to follow him up the hill, and said he would show him a path that led straight down to the sea.Finds the big blue sea When finally Thavalai looked up, he saw it down in the valley ahead. At last, finally, it lay there in front of him. The big, big blue blue sea, its little fingers snaking into the hills around. Thavalai looked at it in wonder, watching the blueness disappear into the distance and meeting the sky somewhere beyond the lands where animals lived. He hopped down towards it, never quite believing that this was not an illusion, a trick of the the wind and the fog and the sun.And when finally he did reach it, he laid a tentative toe in the water, as if it might swallow him whole. It was cool and fresh to the touch. And calm, unlike any water that Thavalai had seen before. The waters in the streams rushed and babbled, and argued and whined, and behaved like juvenile delinquents or raging adults. This quiet wisdom of water he had not seen before.The bigger sea Tree frogs were happy with the little pools that collected in tree boles and tree holes. And compared to a little saucepan of water in the crevice between two crooked branches, this expanse of water was like the universe itself. “Where are you going now?” Ahaetulla asked.“I don’t know,” said Thavalai, “I came to see the sea, and now that I have, maybe I’ll go home.” “But there is so much else to see,” said Ahaetulla, whose forefathers had come up the hill from the west. “This is just a lake, and there is a much bigger sea, at the bottom of mountains, where the sun sets.” “A bigger sea?” cried Thavalai. “How can that even be?”Up the western catchment Up the hill they went, Ahaetulla winding his way up the sinuous path, Thavalai but a few hops behind. They went past a little shola nestled in the cup of the hill’s palm. The cinnamon beckoned him, the familiar smells, the warmth, the wetness. The shola is like a sponge, absorbing the torrents of rain, storing it in every crack, crevice and keyhole, absorbing it into its bark, its mud, its rock, and leaking it out bit by bit, through the little streams that rush out. And then he stopped, because there was a rock in front of him. But it was soft, warm, steaming almost and smelled very strange. “Elephants,” Ahaetulla said. “Is this an elephant?” he asked, thinking it was not as impressive as he thought it may have been. “No, silly, that’s just their poop. Elephants are a thousand times your size. Maybe a zillion.” “But how do they get up here?” “Elephants can go anywhere,” Ahaetulla said mysteriously and went on.To the top of the mountain And then it started to rain. The water came down in buckets, till there were rivulets flowing through the grassland. It can rain for months, yelled Ahaetulla, through the rain. I know, cried Thavalai, in reply. He loved the rain. But the going was getting difficult and slippery. Thavalai could manage on any tree, but the mud and the grass was very uncomfortable. After what seemed like a very long time, they came up to the top. It was covered by a deep fog, and Thavalai sighed. This looked like another wild goose chase. But then the mist cleared.An amphitheatre for the amphibian Everything that Thavalai had seen so far  the tree, the sea, the kurinji flowers  it all paled in comparison. The fog lifted over the grandest stage of all. Three cliffs surrounded the peak that Thavalai and Ahaetulla sat on. “An amphitheatre for the amphibian,” Ahaetulla muttered. Each cliff plunged thousands of feet to land below, sweeping down into a plateau to the south and undulating lush hills to the north, towards bigger, larger peaks.Kestrels wheeled around screaming. The west glowed orange as the sun set, bathing the entire landscape with a soothing light. As evening gave way to twilight, and twilight to darkness, they stayed there on the ridge, watching the west. A small glimmer of light from very, very far caught their eye. Somewhere near the lights, Ahaetulla said, is the sea. And it goes on forever and ever until the end of the world.Heads down the hill to the silent valley Thavalai made up his mind to go on to the big sea, but Ahaetulla would go no further. He pointed him to the Silent Valley. Thavalai wondered why it had been given this name. But after he had been in it for a while, he began to realize why. It was quiet as a tomb. And the trees were tall, unlike in the sholas above. And the lower he descended, the taller they became.This was a magical land. With hornbills, frogmouths, and owls. Strange birds and stranger animals. Sometimes, the forest echoed with the hoots of langurs and the calls of liontailed macaques. In the evening, the forest filled with calls and shrieks and squeaks.Some new froggy friends High above in the canopy, Thavalai could hear the sounds of the birds, ones that he had seen flying around the Big Tree at home. He saw many frogs like Nycti, the torrent frog, who loved the waterwashed rocks as their home. They clung to the wet surface as the rapids splashed and smashed against the rocks, and called from the cracks and laid their eggs on the wet leaves that overhung the streams. At this time, he heard the strangest sound that he had ever heard. It seemed to come from deep within the earth. But that could not be. It sounded so like a frog, and yet not like a frog.The balloon frog incident Then he saw it lumbering towards him, the strangest animal he had ever seen. It seemed quite amorphous and shapeless, purple like rich humus earth. It seemed to flow forward, rather than walk or jump, almost as if it was the mud itself come to life in a strange frog form. Apart from its pointy pig snout, Thavalai could make out no other feature. From the safety of his root haven, Thavalai called out to the creature. Alarmed, it swelled up like a balloon, and looked around with its beady eyes. “Who are you?” Thavalai ventured. Looking at him carefully, the ancient creature answered, “I am the oldest frog of the forest. My ancestors came here long before anyone else. They call me Nasika. I live deep inside the earth most of the time.” “It must be lonely down there, and dark and scary,” said Thavalai. Nasika smiled, as much as her narrow mouth would allow. “It’s a busy world down there,” she said. “There are earthworms, and bugs and beetles, and spiders, and cockroaches, and scorpions. And even snakes.”“Snakes?” said Thavalai in astonishment. “Yes, beautiful shiny snakes with a little shield on their tail that they use to dig. But where do you live, little one?” “Oh, I live up in the tree,” Thavalai said, “up on the mountain.” “You can climb trees!” said Nasika with astonishment now.Flying frogs, lizards and snakes Thavalai decided to climb up a tree to get a breath of fresh sky and plan his next hop, step and jump. He climbed till he reached the canopy. A cloud overhung the valley, little wisps of smoke lingering over the treetops, little rings of cloud hanging like halos over wizened trees. Thavalai’s reverie was interrupted by streaks of colour flying by. Thavalai thought these were more birds, but all of a sudden, a frog landed next to him.A flying frog, he marveled. “I’m Rhaco,” said the flying frog. Soon, Rhaco’s friend, Draco, the flying lizard and Chrysopelea, the flying snake came gliding down to join them, and they engaged in a frenzy of jumping and gliding.The slightly and very venomous snakes Thavalai also met Bamboo Pambu, the slightly venomous snake. Later, he saw a young ratsnake, all bronze and glistening in the rays of sunlight that sneaked through the foliage and survived the maze of leaves. Suddenly, a large pair of jaws closed around the head of the ratsnake and swallowed him whole. It was Hannah, the extremely venomous snake. The snake who ate other snakes. Thavalai looked at her in awe and amazement. Hannah was a striking yellow and black, that went on and on, as far as his eyes could see. He wondered if he should try and follow the path to the end of the snake. But there seemed to be no end to the snake called Hannah!The philosophy of Rana Thavalai wondered how much further he would need to go. At the edge of the forest, everything looked very strange  barren, noisy, peopled. At the edge of a field, he met an even larger frog than Bufo. But he had a really pleasant disposition. “You can call me Rana,” he said, giving him a hug (and rubbing his belly), “though its not my real name. My real name is much longer and you would have trouble pronouncing it.”Rana told him that the sea was far away, and the path held too many dangers. And too few trees. Where once there was forest, there was now field, or city. The real sea was not friendly to frogs, nor was the path to it. “Little seas at home are as grand as big seas in other worlds,” he said. Rana told him that maybe it was time for him to go home after all his adventures.Thavalai goes home Thavalai had learnt that the world was a strange and dangerous place. He did not like the fast torrents that Nycti lived in, nor could he live under the soil like Nasika. He liked the top of trees. On the tops of mountains. And now it was time to return there. Philautus Frog did not go around the world. But he went as far as any tree frog from the Big Tree had ever gone in a very long time. Thavalai, the tree frog turned towards the hills and set off again to go back to his friends and family on the Big Tree.Information The Western Ghats: The Western Ghats are a long chain of mountains running along the west coast of India from the southern tip of the peninsula to the River Tapti in Maharashtra. Sholas and grasslands: In the southern Western Ghats, the tops of the mountains have a unique habitat which consists of undulating plains of grasslands, with small patches of evergreen forests with stunted trees, known as sholas. Frogs and toads: A toad is actually a kind of frog. Toads generally have a dry and warty skin. They tend to be more terrestrial than most other frogs, but usually lay their eggs in the water. Scientific names: Plants and animals are known by scientific names which consist of a genus and species (Eg. Homo sapiens for humans). Scientific names sometimes change on the basis of new discoveries about taxonomy and evolution.Cast of Characters (in order of appearance) Philautus: Philautus are a group of tree frogs or bush frogs found in India, Sri Lanka and South East Asia. Unlike other frogs, most species belonging to this group lay eggs that undergo direct development. That is, they bypass the tadpole stage and little froglets hop out of the eggs! Most bush frogs of the Western Ghats now belong to the genus Raorchestes. Bufo: Bufo is a genus of toads. The common toad in India was long known by the scientific name, Bufo melanostictus; it is now called Duttaphrynus melanostictus. Sally A: Salea are agamid lizards, part of the same family as the garden lizards, Calotes. Ahaetulla: Ahaetulla is a genus of grass snakes. The common vine snake, which is found all over India, is also a species that belongs to the genus Ahaetulla.Nasika: The frog, Nasikabatracus sahyadrensis, was discovered only a few years ago. It is believed to be one of the oldest frogs in India, which means it has remained relatively unchanged for over  million years. Its closest relatives live in Seychelles. Nycti: Nyctibatrachus are torrent frogs which live in fastflowing streams in the Western Ghats. Rhaco: Rhacophorus are also tree frogs, and some are known for their gliding ability; they build foam nests attached to leaves hanging over water bodies. Draco: Draco is a lizard and Chrysopelea is a snake, both known for their gliding ability. Hannah: The king cobra, or Ophiophagus hannah, is the world’s longest venomous snake and feeds exclusively on other snakes. Bamboo Pambu: This refers to the common and mildly venomous bamboo pit viper. Rana: Rana is a genus of frogs, now known by several different names. The bull frog, once called Rana tigerina, is now called Hoplobatrachus tigerinus. It is the largest frog in India.	./Story text files/336.txt	17689	19	6.043778801843318	1348	388	229	70.04417670682732	89	160	43	13.72289156626506	70	179	958	778	6	1.5502318392581145	1637	304
“I wish I had a HOUSE!” said Mrs Penguin. “I don’t like living in rubbish.” “Dear Mrs Penguin,” said Papa Penguin. “We will build you a palace.”So the Penguin family set to work. “The sand is making me itch,” grumbled Sissie. “I’m hungry,” said Gobbles. “The measurements are wrong,” said Boetie.

Mrs Penguin was cross. “I’m not doing any more work,” she said.“We’ll try again,” said Papa. “I can’t think of anything,” said Sisi. “It’s too hard.” “We haven’t got any cement,” said Boetie. “You can’t build a proper house without cement.” “I’m hungry,” said Gobbles. Mrs Penguin sighed. She was never going to get her home.“Just look at all this mess,” she said. Then Mrs Penguin had an idea.“Boetie, fetch wood,” she said. “Gobbles, pick up plastic. Papa, fetch the hammer.” All day they worked. “Sissie, find nets.”“I’m tired,” said Sissie. “Keep working,” said Mama. “The measurements are wrong,” said Boetie. “Keep working,” said Mama. “I’m still hungry,” said Gobbles. “Keep working,” said Mama.“It’s going to be wonderful,” said Papa. “You’re doing a good job,” said Mama. So they worked and worked and worked and worked … … and at last the house was finished.“Welcome to your palace,” said Papa. Mrs Penguin clapped her flippers. “Thank you,” she said. “It’s Mrs Penguin’s Perfect Palace.”	./Story text files/378.txt	1724	17	5.87378640776699	161	45	87	32.17307692307692	50	2	19	6.519230769230769	44	8	108	98	4	1.263779527559055	243	11

"It was five o'clock in the morning. The sun was still asleep. Chinni yawned as she rode on Abba's cycle. She helped him in his bakery before going to school.Creak. . . went the old bakery shutter as Abba pulled it up. ""I'm so sleepy, "" said Chinni. Abba smiled. ""Today is a special day. "" ""Oh yes, Bimla's birthday! "" said Chinni. She was jumping up and down. Bimla was Chinni's best friend.""Would you like to bake her a cake? "" asked Abba. ""Yes, yes, yes! "" said Chinni happily. Abba and Chinni brought the things they needed from the storeroom. Flour Butter Sugar Baking powder Eggs Milk""How about some chocolate? "" asked Chinni. ""Bimla loves chocolate. "" It was Chinni's favourite too. ""Good idea, "" said Abba. He got some cocoa powder and put it in a bowl.""This doesn't look like chocolate, "" said Chinni, sniffing the bowl. That made her sneeze. ""When we mix cocoa powder, butter and sugar, it becomes chocolate, "" said Abba.""Ooh, magic! "" Chinni's eyes became round. ""No, chemistry! "" said Abba with a smile. ""What is kehmisstree, Abba? "" asked Chinni. ""When different things come together and change into new things, it is chemistry. "" ""Is baking a cake kehmisstree too? "" ""Yes, it is! ""Abba mixed the butter and sugar till they were creamy. Then he showed Chinni how to break the eggs. Oops, one fell to the floor. ""Oh no! "" said Chinni. ""It's okay, "" said Abba. ""We can clean it up. ""Chinni beat the eggs with a whisk. ""My arms are aching, "" she complained. ""You are doing a great job. Beating the eggs makes the cake light and spongy, "" said Abba. He mixed the flour, baking powder and cocoa powder together with a pinch of. . . ""Salt? ""Chinni was surprised. ""Bimla won't like a salty cake. "" ""A little salt makes the cake taste sweeter, "" said Abba. ""It also helps to hold up the cake. """"Is that chemistry too? "" asked Chinni. ""That's right! "" said Abba. Chinni looked at the dough. ""This is all wet and mushy, "" she said. ""It doesn't look like cake at all. "" Abba turned on the oven. ""That's why we heat it, "" he said.""Heat changes the egg and helps the cake become firm. When water is mixed with baking powder, gases are formed, giving rise to bubbles. This makes the cake rise and become light. And butter and milk keep it soft. "" ""What about the chocolate? "" This was very important to Chinni! ""The cocoa powder will mix with the sugar and the butter, and become chocolate in the cake, "" said Abba.Soon a delicious aroma filled the bakery. Chinni and Abba wore thick gloves. Then, they took the hot cake out of the oven carefully. Abba would have to wait for the cake to cool. Then, he would add some icing and decorate the cake.After school, Bimla and Chinni walked to the bakery. Abba was waiting at the door. ""Surprise! "" said father and daughter in chorus and led Bimla in. ""Happy Birthday, Bimla! "" Chinni stuffed a piece of cake into her friend's mouth. ""Mmmm . . . oh how is this cake so spongy? "" We know how. Don't you?Chemistry  the science of change Chemistry (pronounced kehmisstree): The study of matter and how it changes. Matter: Just another word for 'things'. Everything in this world is made of matter. And matter is made of little bits called molecules. And molecules are made of even tinier bits called atoms.Chemical reaction: When the atoms of one molecule combine with other atoms, new molecules are formed. This is called a chemical reaction. Chemistry all around us: Chemistry is everywhere. It is in the air we breathe, the soap we use for bathing, and the medicines we take when we fall sick. And, of course, in the food we eat.Chemical reactions in baking . Water and wheat flour: Wheat has a protein called gluten. When water is mixed with wheat flour, the gluten becomes sticky, like glue. This makes the dough elastic and helps the cake to rise. It gives the cake body when n is heated in the oven. . Baking powder: When baking powder is mixed with water, carbon dioxide gas is released. This forms bubbles and helps the cake rise and become spongy.. Eggs: When eggs cook in the heat of the oven, they make the cake firm while still keeping it moist. Beaten eggs also trap air bubbles, making the cake light. . Chocolate: Cocoa powder is bitter. But when we mix it with the right amount of butter and sugar, and heat the mixture, it becomes yummy chocolate."	./Story text files/58.txt	4303	14	5.3313953488372094	444	72	111	36.426086956521736	83	32	23	7.843478260869565	72	43	286	230	4	1.3225283630470017	565	52
"Long ago, a lion, a fox, an ape and a hyena lived together.The ape and the hyena plotted to harm the fox. They secretly went to meet the lion.""Lion, you are much respected, but why don't you have shoes? "" the ape asked the lion.""You are right. Who can make shoes for me? "" asked the lion.""The fox can make shoes for you, "" replied the hyena.""Call the fox, "" said the lion. The fox came, and the lion told her to make shoes for him.""The best shoes are made from the skins of apes and hyenas, "" whispered the fox.""I want the finest shoes, "" said the lion. So he killed the hyena and the ape. He gave their skins to the fox.The fox was worried that the lion would kill her if she did not make the shoes. She put the skins into the river.The lion became impatient. ""Where are my shoes? "" he growled. Fox replied, ""I am still waiting for the skins to soften. ""The next morning, the fox came running from the river. She told the lion, ""Someone just like you is guarding the skins. I can't get them! ""The lion rushed to the river. He saw his own reflection in the water, and jumped in to fight! The lion drowned, leaving the fox alone."	./Story text files/25.txt	1128	12	5.145161290322581	106	18	79	39.32142857142857	18	10	17	8.821428571428571	15	13	66	58	3	1.193103448275862	139	6
"One sunny morning, the woodcutter of Gura set out to get some firewood. He walked across the plain until he came to the great big olive tree by the river. He climbed the tree and perched himself at the end of the largest branch. Then he made himself comfortable, swung his axe, and began to cut the branch on which he was sitting. The village priest, who was passing by, looked up at the woodcutter and stopped to talk to him. “Brother, what are you doing?” he cried. “That’s no way to chop wood!” “What other way is there?” answered the woodcutter. “If you want wood, you must lift your axe and keep going chopchopchop! "" “But you’re sitting at the end of the branch and chopping it in the middle! The branch will break, and when it does, you’ll fall down and die,” warned the priest.The woodcutter thought the priest was joking. In any case, he was stubborn and lazy, and didn’t want to get up and change his position, so the priest shook his head and walked away. And the woodcutter sat exactly where he was, and went chopchopchop, once again.Suddenly, there was a mighty loud crack, and down crashed the branch, the man and his axe! As he lay on the ground, dazed and bewildered and aching everywhere, the woodcutter remembered his conversation with the priest. “The priest said three things – that the branch would break, that I would fall…and be killed. The priest was right. The branch broke just as he said it would, and I fell too.The priest is indeed a very wise man, so whatever he says must be true. Ah, me! Then I must be dead!” It did not take the woodcutter long to convince himself that he was really dead. So he just closed his eyes and lay on the ground without moving. After a while, his friends came along and called out to him, but the woodcutter lay perfectly still. They shook him and splashed water on his faced. But the woodcutter neither spoke nor moved as he had made up his mind that he was quite dead. They tried to make him stand, but the woodcutter thought to himself, “Surely, a dead man can’t stand up!” and promptly fell down again. Now his friends too were convinced that he was dead. So they lifted him up and began to carry him back to the village. “Pick up my axe!” shouted the woodcutter, and they did. Soon they came to a fork in the path and there they stopped. Should they turn right or left? The friends stood there and began to argue long and loud.The woodcutter got so irritated that he sat up and pointed out the way. Then he lay down and shut his eyes again. And his friends carried him to the village saying, “Ah, what a clever man! He always knew the answer to everything. What a pity he’s dead!” Soon they reached the woodcutter’s house, but found no one at home. So they put him on the floor and began to argue about what they should do next.“Send for my wife, of course!” the woodcutter cut in angrily. “Right away, brother! Who would have thought that a dead man could come up with such a clever idea!” marveled his friends, and they promptly sent for his wife. Sobbing and wailing, the woodcutter’s wife appeared, and many of the villagers followed her into the house.“A branch fell on him and killed him,” the friends began to explain. “No! No! No!” exclaimed the woodcutter, “How many times am I to tell you I was sitting on the branch and it broke?” “But my husband is talking! How can he be dead! What happened to him?” cried the woodcutter’s wife. “How…when…what…. Woman, it’s not respectful to ask the dead all those questions,” said the friends. “I tell you he isn’t dead at all,” said the woodcutter’s wife. “Use your brains!” The woodcutter was getting irritated now. “The wise priest told me the branch would break, and I would surely fall down and die. The branch broke and I fell. The priest was speaking the truth. So I must be dead.”“Nonsense! In any case, the priest didn’t see you after you fell, so…” began his wife. “Nag! Nag! Nag!” said the woodcutter getting up from the ground in disgust. He picked up his axe and went out of the house. “Where are you going?” asked his wife. “To get some firewood so that you can cook dinner,” he said, walking away. “What a fine man!” murmured his friends. “Even when he’s dead he doesn’t forget his duty!” * * * And that is why it is often said, “A fool always finds one still more foolish to admire him!”RAFT CRAFT What do you think the woodcutter of Gura was chopping wood for? Perhaps to light a fire and cook his food. What other uses of wood can you think of? Do you know that people sail across lakes and rivers in rafts made with logs of wood tied together? How about making your own toy raft? It’s easy – grab some sticks or twigs… and get, set, and sail away!You need: A.  straight twigs or sticks  cm long. (They should be about as thick as your little finger) B. String C. Thick paper cut into a triangle  cm in height for the sail. (You could also cut out a colourful picture from a magazine cover or paint your own picture for the sail. )TO MAKE THE RAFT . Take  sticks and place them side by side. . Place a stick across each end of the raft as shown. Tie the sticks together with the string to secure your raft. . Take another stick (this will be your mast) and poke it through the sail as shown. Be careful not to tear the sail when yo do this. . Push the lower end of the sail (the mast, that is) down the middle of the raft, between the th and th sticks. The mast should stay up straight. Now find a pool or a puddle or even a bucket of water, and set your raft to sail. Enjoy!"	./Story text files/237.txt	5506	16	5.561371841155235	463	91	135	49.522935779816514	58	51	28	10.55045871559633	49	60	327	227	5	1.2534992223950234	585	58
“Story time!” Suvi rushed into her grandmother’s arms. It was a warm night and the stars lit up a cloudless sky. Paati was visiting Suvi this summer. “Shall we continue with the Ramayana?” asked Paati. “Yes!” said Suvi. Paati had already told her about the war where Rama defeated Ravana, the king of Lanka. Now Paati picked up from where she had left off.“After Ravana was killed, Rama had to return to Ayodhya, his kingdom far, far away. So Vibhishana, the new king of Lanka, gave him a magic chariot. It was called Pushpaka Vimana and could fly on its own.” “How did it know where to go?” asked Suvi.“Oh, the traveller just had to give it a command,” said Paati. “That’s just like a driverless car!” said Suvi. Paati’s eyes grew round. She said, “A car without a driver! What is this amazing thing?” “A car that can drive on its own,” sang Suvi. “I don’t believe it!” said Paati. “How can a car drive by itself? By magic?” “Not magic, Paati,” said Suvi. “Science!” “Then tell me,” asked Paati, “how does this driverless car work?”Suvi wasn’t sure. She turned on the computer to look it up. While she was trying to connect to the internet, Suvi asked, “Do you drive, Paati?” “I used to ride a scooter many years ago,” she replied. “But now I’m scared to even walk on the streets. I’m afraid I will bump into somebody or get hit!”Suvi and Paati were looking at the screen. One website said driverless cars were also called self driving cars. “And there’s a computer, just like this one, inside each car,” said Suvi, patting the desktop. “And cameras and sensors. The computer uses these to make a picture of the road around the car.” “This picture,” she went on, “tells the car how far away other objects are. Like a tree or a road divider. That way, the car can avoid crashing into them. The same sensors also show the car where and how to park.”“But how does the car know where it is and where to go?” Paati wondered. “The car’s computer has maps in it, which tell it where it is. When we give it an address, these maps can figure out how to get us there,” Suvi explained.Just then, Appa came in. He looked very tired. “What’s the matter?” asked Paati. “Traffic is a nightmare!” Appa grumbled. “Everybody is in a hurry, nobody follows the rules.” “If everyone was in a driverless car, this wouldn’t be a problem!” Suvi said. Paati turned to her in surprise. Suvi continued, “The engineers who build the car’s computer put all the traffic rules in it. So when the computer makes a decision, it checks to see if the car is following the rules.”“Hmm…” said Paati. “Let’s say the car starts moving when the traffic light turns green but someone crosses the street suddenly. Wouldn’t the car hit them? A human driver might be able to stop the car.”“I had to do that today!” said Appa. “A man speaking on his phone wandered across when the pedestrian light was red. I stopped just in time. Phew!” “My goodness!” said Paati, looking worried.“The selfdriving car’s first rule,” said Suvi, reading from the screen, “is not to hit anything or anybody. So even if the traffic rule says the car can go, its sensors will stop it if there’s something in front.” “Are you saying the computer understands that not hitting anything is more important?” asked Paati. “Exactly!” replied Suvi.“But can a computer make the car stop faster than a driver can?” “Oh yes, Paati,” said Suvi. “It can make decisions much faster than a human being can. And it never gets tired or sleepy.” “And I am sure computercontrolled cars would never try to break the rules to get ahead like many drivers do,” said Appa. “Did you know drivers’ mistakes are responsible for almost % of car accidents?” Then he added cheerfully, “In a driverless car, I could work or push my seat back and relax while the car does its job.” “Safer roads and fewer accidents mean less worry,” said Paati, looking at Appa fondly. “I don’t know if our Pushpaka Vimana stories are fact or fiction, but science is truly magical!”Did you know? . The earliest idea for the driverless car can be traced to Leonardo Da Vinci, the famous Italian painter, sculptor, and inventor. In the th century, he sketched a blueprint of a cart that could move on its own. In , a car was guided through traffic in New York City via radio signals sent from another car following close behind.. Selfdriving cars are still being tested by computer and car companies. Some such cars can be found on the roads of Western countries. But someone is always in the driver’s seat to make sure there are no accidents. . In India, plans are underway to allow similar testing of driverless cars. But with so many people and so much traffic on our roads, this is going to be a challenge!. Over one million people in the world die in car crashes every year. Imagine how many lives driverless cars could save. . Driverless cars can ‘see’ and drive in complete darkness, thanks to their maps and sensors. . Some existing cars already have features like automatic braking, lane keeping and cruise control.	./Story text files/525.txt	5008	18	5.686379928315413	443	115	128	46.25471698113208	61	45	25	9.471698113207546	54	52	322	236	6	1.4722222222222223	566	82
"I was born in summer, in a town called Matatiele in the Eastern Cape. Matatiele is near Lesotho where there are many mountains. In the winter they are covered with snow.My father was a builder and he moved from place to place to find work. We moved to Lesotho and that's where I started school. I was very happy. But when I was eleven years old, I grew tired and weak, and then I couldn't walk. My parents took me to the hospital.""I don't know. We must do some special tests to find out. "" ""What is wrong, doctor? ""I had to stay in hospital for three years. I was very tired and I slept many hours every day. After three years the doctors told me I would not be able to walk again. I was very sad because I love sports.""We think Zanele has got TB in her spine. It has attacked her nerves. I am very sorry, but she will be in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. ""I went to a special school in Umtata, and my teachers encouraged me. It was a very busy school, with lots of activities like sport and sewing. On weekends we had tasks to do. We had to clean our rooms, polish our shoes and clean our wheelchairs.""Zanele, how far can you throw this javelin? ""I decided to keep trying, and never give up. If you have a disability, you can still do something you love. I love to see how far I can go, so I entered a competition.I won a bronze medal for shot putt, a silver medal for discus and a gold medal for javelin.I wanted to get better and better at my sports, so I trained very hard. ""Well done, Zanele – you are really improving! ""When I rested, I loved to sew and listen to gospel music.I entered more competitions and I got many medals and prizes. I started to dream about maybe competing in the Paralympics one day.The Paralympics are just like the Olympics, where the best athletes in the world compete for gold, silver and bronze medals. But in the Paralympics, the athletes are disabled in different ways, so they have to try even harder to train and win!Then I heard that I was going to Sydney in Australia, to take part in the  Paralympics. At last we were in the plane, flying over the Indian Ocean!​I am so excited!But when I got there, I suddenly felt very scared of all the people watching me. I just wanted to go home again.Then, when I threw my javelin it landed far in front of everyone's. I broke the world record and I got a gold medal!I was the first African woman to win a gold medal in the Paralympics. I was so happy and very proud.My motto is: Keep going, follow your dreams and never give up. Even if something happens to make you sad or scared. That is what I teach my little girl, Azamazi. She is eight years old and she also loves to do athletics and gymnastics. I am still training and going to competitions, and in  I hope to go to the Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro."	./Story text files/88.txt	2797	20	5.830258302583026	223	48	123	56.10204081632653	20	29	23	12.0	11	38	178	93	5	1.5098684210526316	256	48
Numbers. We use them everyday. To count, measure, call friends on the phone and even to find out what something costs. But did you know you can also use numbers to create patterns  geometrical shapes, rangoli designs, and more? Did you know number patterns can be seen within patterns in nature?But first, what is a 'Number Pattern'? A Number Pattern is a sequence of numbers where each number is connected to the previous one in ONE specific way. Take this very simple number pattern: , , , , . . . How is each number in this sequence connected to the one before it? Well, every number in this sequence is the previous number with  ADDED to it. Here's another number pattern: , , , , . . . Each number in this sequence is the previous number with  SUBTRACTED from it.Now for a slightly more tricky pattern: , , , , , . . . How does this sequence work? Let's see.  +  =   +  =   +  =   +  =   +  =  Do you see the pattern here? What will the next number in this sequence be? Yes, , because  +  = .Now, let’s take the 'number pattern' we just discussed: , , , , . . . , and see if we can create a 'SHAPE pattern' from it. We can! We now have a 'shape pattern' of triangles that get bigger and bigger as we increase the number of dots according to our number pattern! A number pattern has become a shape pattern!If you found that interesting, it's time you were introduced to a beautiful number sequence called the Fibonacci (or Hemachandra) Sequence of numbers. The Fibonacci Sequence of numbers goes like this: , , , , , , , , , . . . Can you find the pattern that connects these numbers? Yes! Every number in the Fibonacci Sequence is the sum of the two numbers before it! Like this. + =  + =  + =  + =  + =  + =  + =  + =  Got it? Good. Now for the REALLY interesting part  linking this number pattern to patterns in nature.The number of petals flowers have are often linked to Fibonacci numbers! Can you think of flowers with ,  and  petals? (These are all Fibonacci numbers. ) Here are some examples to help you along.  petal  . Anthurium; . Calla lilies  petals  . Bougainvillea; . Clovers  petals  . Temple tree; . Hibiscus; . JasmineFlowers with  petals are not very common. The Crown of Thorns, which you see here, is one example. Flowers with  petals ( is NOT a Fibonacci number) are also rare. Count the petals of flowers that you come across and see for yourself!The most interesting flower of all, where the Fibonacci sequence is concerned, is the daisy. Different daisy species have , , or  petals  which are all Fibonacci Numbers!There are even more complex and stunning patterns in nature that appear to be based on the Fibonacci numbers. If you are willing to do a little math, you can see it for yourself. Shall we try it out? Now, what would we get if we squared* each of the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence? Fibonacci Sequence: , , , , , , , etc. If we 'squared' each of these numbers, we would get:  x  =  Squared or =   x  =  Squared or =   x  =  Squared or =   x  =  Squared or =   x  =  Squared or =   x  =  Squared or =  So the Fibonacci Sequence Squared:  –    –  –  –   etc. *When you multiply a number by itself, the number is 'squared'.Now, just like we converted a number pattern into a shape pattern with the triangles before, let's try to convert the Fibonacci Sequence Squared into a shape pattern. Let's try to DRAW ,  ,  and so on.  is easy enough – it is just one square.  is drawn like this   squares across and  squares down. We know that  = , and there are  squares in the figure (we call this figure a 'grid').Similarly,  is drawn as  squares across and  squares down. Again, we know that  = , and there are  squares in the grid.  is drawn as  squares across and  squares down, making a grid with  squares,  as  squares across and  squares down, making a grid with  squares,  squared is drawn as a grid with  squares, and so on.Now, let's push all the grids we've drawn so far towards each other, and arrange them like in the picture. Done? Now draw a smooth curved line from one corner of the smallest grid to its opposite end, as shown in the figure.Now take the same curved line through each of the other grids, from smallest to biggest, from corner to opposite corner, ending with the  squared grid. What we get is a lovely spiral pattern. What is the link between this spiral pattern created by squared Fibonacci numbers, and nature? Well, the exact same Fibonacci Spiral can be found in nature! Where? Let's see, shall we?Here's the Fibonacci Spiral with one more grid    added to our original figure. See how the spiral continues? Does the spiral look familiar?Of course it does! You can see the Fibonacci spiral in seashells (although you might have to twist your head around a bit to see the exact spiral pattern of the previous page). . .. . . snail shells. . . even eggs (see how this spiral goes the other way (anticlockwise) as compared to the clockwise spiral on page ? )!Even larger structures like hurricanes and even some galaxies seem to follow the Fibonacci Spiral pattern. Fascinating, isn’t it?A BRIEF HISTORY To end this exciting tale of Fibonacci Numbers, let's touch briefly upon the history of the Fibonacci Number Sequence. In the th century (almost  years ago), a Jain scholar and monk called Hemachandra, who lived in presentday Gujarat, discovered an interesting mathematical pattern while studying poetry and music. He was looking at the number of different ways in which you could combine 'long' and 'short' sounds in music to create different rhythmic patterns. Around  years later, an Italian mathematician called Leonardo Fibonacci (c.  – c. ) – wrote about the very same mathematical pattern in his book Liber Abaci, or 'Book of Calculation' in . Fibonacci travelled extensively along the Mediterranean coast, meeting merchants from the East and finding out about how they did mathematics. It is possible that Fibonacci came across Hemachandra's sequence during his travels, but since he was the first one to introduce it to Europe, these numbers became known to the world as the Fibonacci Sequence.A word of caution: Although there are many examples in nature that seem to follow the Fibonacci pattern, there are also many examples in nature that do not – like four leaved clovers, or flowers with  petals. What's intriguing, though, is how often these Fibonacci Numbers do appear in nature. So far, scientists haven't figured out WHY nature seems to love Fibonacci numbers so much. Maybe YOU can find the answer when you grow up!	./Story text files/157.txt	6507	18	5.4404432132963985	548	174	234	56.5929203539823	60	53	83	12.327433628318584	46	67	382	340	5	1.338852097130243	806	100

"Putta and Putti jumped out of bed. It was Muttajji's birthday and they had a train to catch!Muttajji, who was the twins' mother's mother's mother, lived in Mysore with Ajji, who was the twins' mother's mother. No one actually knew when Muttajji's birthday was; but Ajji had always celebrated it on the Makara Sankranthi holiday. ""Amma, will there be a cake? "" asked Putti. ""A big, spongy cake with pink icing and a rose on top? "" ""Naah, "" said Putta. ""Old people don't have birthday cakes. And  candles won't fit on any cake. "" ""Muttajji isn't  years old, silly, "" said Putti. ""How old is Muttajji, Amma? "" Amma smiled. ""Why don't you ask her when we get there? ""The moment they reached the old green house in Mysore, the twins burst into Muttajji's room. ""Happy birthday, Muttajji! How old are you today? "" Muttajji hugged the twins. ""How old am I? Who knows? How does it matter? "" ""But it does! "" cried Putta and Putti together.Muttajji smiled. ""Well, "" she said, ""I know that around five years before I was born, our Maharaja went to a grand party for Indian Maharajas and Maharanis in Delhi. A British king and queen had come to visit, and our Maharaja got a gold medal. "" ""Oooh! A party! There must have been lots of cake! "" said Putti. ""Who was this king, Muttajji? If you know, we can find out which year he visited. if we add five years to that, we will know when YOU were born! "" Muttajji shrugged. ""I've forgotten, Putta. "" Putta's face fell.""Wait, "" said Muttajji. ""Let me see if I can remember something else. Aaaan! When I was about your age  nine or ten  my uncle from Bombay visited us and told us about clean trains. "" ""Clean trains? "" ""Yes! "" Muttajji was excited. ""They had started running in Bombay that year. You never got dirty travelling in them. No black dust on your clothes and face, no grime, nothing! "" The twins stared at her. Why would anyone get dirty travelling by train?""Some years later, "" continued Muttajji, ""I got married. The law was that a girl should be at least  before she was married, and my father would never break the law, so I must have been  then. Very soon after my marriage, your Muttajja got a job in Bombay, and we left Mysore. "" ""Did anything important happen the year you got married, Muttajji? "" asked Putta. ""Yes, "" said Muttajji sadly. ""Our Maharaja inaugurated our big dam, and the beautiful gardens next to it, during the Dasara festival that year. But I missed it; I was in Bombay. "" ""A big dam? "" Putta sat up. ""Is it still there? ""Muttajji hooted with laughter. ""Of course! Rocksolid too. It was the dam that tamed the Kaveri. No more floods in the monsoon, and enough water for the fields in the summer. "" Ajji put her head around the door. ""Are you talking about KRS, Amma? "" ""Aaaan, KRS, "" Muttajji said, looking fondly at Ajji. ""Your Ajji was my fifth child, the youngest, but always the smartest. Do you know, twins, my children came like clockwork, one every two monsoons. The day your Ajji decided to come out, your Muttajja could not be found. Later, he told us that he had gone to see Gandhiji give a speech at the Gowalia Tank Maidan. He was so excited. 'Quit India! ' he kept shouting the whole day, silly man, disturbing the baby.

""""Maybe this will help, twins, "" said Ajji, bringing in bowls of vermicelli payasa, Muttajji's favourite sweet dish. ""KRS is the Krishnarajasagar Dam. The Brindavan Gardens are the gardens attached to it. We went there last year to see the musical fountains, remember? "" The twins nodded. ""Mmmm, "" said Putti. ""Your payasa is the BEST, Ajji! "" ""When was KRS built, do you know, Ajji? "" Ajji shook her head. ""I'm not sure. But you can go with Ajja to the central library after lunch and find out there. ""In the library, Putti found a book on the history of Mysore. ""Here it is! "" she whispered.

""Ajja, "" whispered Putti, ""in the olden days, did people get dirty travelling by train? "" Ajja nodded. ""There were steam engines then, which ran on coal, not electricity, "" he said. ""Black coal dust used to fly out of the chimney and land on everyone and everything. Terrible! "" ""That's it, Putti! "" hissed Putta. ""Electric trains were the 'clean' trains! ""He pulled out a book on the Indian Railways. ""It says here, "" he pointed, ""that India's first electric train came to Bombay in ! "" ""And Muttajji says she was about  then, "" said Putta. ""If she is right, then Muttajji was born in *. "" ""But she could be wrong, you know, "" frowned Putti. ""Only one way to make sure, "" said Putta.

It was the year the Gateway of India was built in Bombay. And yes, it was built to welcome the British Emperor of India, George V! There must have been several grand parties, not one. "" Ajja tapped his forehead, looking very pleased with himself. ""Not bad for an old brain, eh? "" ""Not bad at all! "" cried the twins. ""Thanks, Ajja! "" They knew exactly how old Muttajji was!Five minutes later, the twins were racing homewards. ""Muttajji, "" they panted, rushing straight to her room, ""did the Mysore Maharaja get his gold medal from King George V? "" ""Aaaaaan! "" Muttajji said happily. ""That's it! George! What clever children you are! "" ""That means, Muttajji, that you were born in ! You are exactly * years old today! "" *(   = )""That's great detective work, twins! "" smiled Amma. ""I think you  and Muttajji  deserve a special treat. A big, spongy one, with pink icing, and a rose on top. "" ""Hurrayyyyyy! "" cheered the twins.The Grand MaharajaMaharani Party (and other fun stuff from Indian history) Remember all the important historical events Muttajji talked about in the story? They all really happened! Here is a little more information about them.The Grand MaharajaMaharani Party ()  When the British Emperor George V and his wife Queen Mary visited India for the first time, they hosted a grand party for over  Indian kings and queens. It was called the Delhi Durbar. To feed ,  guests, bakeries put out  loaves of bread a day, and over  cattle and sheep were slaughtered for every meal! Many Indian rulers received gold medals from the Emperor, including the Maharaja of Mysore, Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV.The Clean Trains ()  On Feb , , India's first electric train left Bombay's Victoria Terminus for Kurla station. With that, India became the rd country in Asia and only the th in the world to introduce railway electrification. The Dam That Tamed The Kaveri ()  The Kaveri river runs through southern Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The river was always a blessing, keeping Mysore fertile, but, like every other river, it used to flood in the monsoons and run dry in the summer. All that changed when a dam was built across the river and the Krishna Raja Sagara (KRS) reservoir created. The reservoir still provides most of the drinking water for Bangalore city.Gandhiji's Big Speech ()  The 'Quit India Speech' was a speech made by Gandhiji on  August , at the Gowalia Tank Maidan in Bombay. Gandhiji asked people to fight against British rule not by using violence, but by disobeying their laws. Five years later, on August , , the non violent war got the results Gandhiji wanted  the British left, and India became independent. Today, the Gowalia Tank Maidan is called the August Kranti Maidan in memory of that peaceful revolution."	./Story text files/158.txt	8881	17	5.19327731092437	891	180	188	45.260416666666664	125	67	37	9.75	109	83	579	492	8	1.3315175097276264	1122	163
It was Meethi Id, a time for celebration for everyone in Lucknow. The people in the bazaar were all wearing new clothes. The shops were filled with sweets—imartis and laddoos, syrupy jalebis, dil bahars and chamchams. There were also delicious savouries: meat kababs and sizzling potato tikkis. The chowk was well known for its shops selling all kinds of food, cloth and silver jewellery. Mehrunissa and Kamrunissa and their brother Azhar Mian were carrying bundles of gifts and leaf plates full of sweets and savouries. They were very proud of the new clothes with fine chikan embroidery that they were wearing, presents they had received for Id. Mehru’s kurta had deep pink flowers and Kamru’s had floral and paisley designs. Azhar Mian was particularly pleased with his new cap which was very finely embroidered.Abbu, their father, was a contractor. The wholesale merchants in the chowk gave him fabrics which he got embroidered by women in their homes in fine chikan work. The women were paid by the merchant for every piece they worked on. Abbu, too, got a commission on each piece. Since Abbu made enough money, Ammi, their mother, did not have to do embroidery like the other women. Kamru and Mehru went to the madrasa in the mosque, while Azhar went to the boys’ school. Kamru and Merhu did do some embroidery, and everyone praised their work more than it deserved because their father was the contractor who got work for all the women in the neighbourhood.Suddenly Azhar stopped. ‘Nobody is giving a thought to our third sister who is at home and is not wearing anything new today, ’ he said. ‘Mumtaz is not our sister, she is our cousin. And she is at home because she can’t walk! ’ said Mehru and Kamru together. ‘But, yes, we should take some sweets for her too. ’ The children had reached the fair on the banks of the river Gomti by this time. There were many tempting things for sale— glittering glass bangles, ribbons, necklaces, clay birds, animals, soldiers and dolls! There was something for everyone. Filled with excitement, the children forgot all about their cousin. Mumtaz sat alone in the house of Abida Khala, the children’s aunt. Her crutches were in a corner nearby. She held a piece of embroidery in her hands, but her thoughts were far away—in Hardoi where her ammi and two sisters lived. Were they missing her as much as she missed them? After Mumtaz’s father had died, there had never been very much money. One day, Abida Khala came and asked her mother to gather all the women of the mohalla to do their embroidery work together. From then on, the women sat together on charpois and mats in their courtyard each day, listening to songs on the radio as they worked away on the fabrics. Mumtaz’s job was to provide tea for the younger women, while the older khalas had their betelleaf boxes always at hand.Gossip was always hotter than the tea, but work went on relentlessly till the evening when each woman folded her embroidery to go home and prepare dinner for the men who would return soon from work. The fabrics they embroidered were collected by Abida Khala, who sent it to Kamru and Mehru’s Abbu. He sent back payments and more fabric. A while ago, Mumtaz had been sent to Lucknow with Abida Khala to learn new chikan stitches that she could teach the women in Hardoi. Though it was far from home, Mumtaz was not too unhappy. She had her special parrot Munia and two pigeons Lakka and Lotan, who she had brought from Hardoi with her.All the three birds were very talented. Lakka could fly to amazing heights. Lotan was an astounding tumbler, dancer and acrobat, constantly active. Munia could actually mimic human speech! Mumtaz continuously coaxed Munia to imitate her. As Mumtaz worked, Lakka and Lotan were always up to their antics. They would eat the grain they were offered and fly off into the clouds, only to come back minutes later for more food. Mumtaz also made a new friend in Lucknow. This was Munnu, the local vegetable seller’s eightyearold son. He accompanied his father as he went around vending his wares and calling out in his special singsong way, ‘Sabzi leylooooo! ’ Recently, he and Mumtaz had become friends. Every day, she would share her snacks with him, and they would sit and watch Lakka and Lotan play.On the day of Id, as the two friends sat together watching the birds, Munnu noticed that Mumtaz looked as though she was going to cry. ‘Why are you sad, apa? ’ he asked. ‘Are you thinking of Hardoi? Do you have more birds there? ’ ‘No, no more birds, just my mother and my sisters Rehana and Salma, ’ Mumtaz said. She picked up her embroidery. ‘Who taught you this embroidery? ’ Munnu asked. ‘Chikankari has been in our family for three generations. I learnt from my mother and she learnt from her mother, ’ said Mumtaz. ‘My nani was from Fatehganj in Lucknow, which was famous for two kinds of embroidery, kataocutwork and chikankari. She told me stories of nawabs and begums; of the baradari, the twelvedoor palace; and of ghazals and shairi. She used to cook delicious biryani, kababs and savaiyan. She always wore a white chikan chadar; I still have it. ’ Mumtaz’s face brightened as she told Munnu about her grandmother. ‘I have always seen my mother with embroidery in her hands, the needle going in and out of the fabric all day long. ’ ‘You mean, she never went out of the house? ’ Munnu asked.‘Only occasionally, to buy the groceries or to visit relatives. Even Rehana and Salma don’t go out very often, and they wear a dupatta when they do. My mother wears a burqa. My sisters never went to school, but I studied till class eight. After that, I have been home, learning how to do this from my mother and sisters, ’ said Mumtaz. ‘So you did go to school! ’ said Munnu admiringly. He had never been to school at all as he had been helping his father since he was a little boy.‘Yes, I am one of the few girls among chikan workers who went to school. My mother cannot read and write. She could never calculate how much the merchant should pay her for her work. I helped her with the counting but, later, since we needed more money, I started embroidering too. ’ Mumtaz paused and said softly, ‘I miss her so much, sometimes I cry all night. ’ Munnu wanted to cheer his friend up so he changed the subject. ‘Do you have dreams at night? ’ ‘Oh, I dream I am flying away, just like Lotan and Lakka. I travel to many places, ’ said Mumtaz, ‘and maybe one day I’ll be able to meet my nani . . . ’ ‘Go quickly and get your nani’s chadar. I’ll show you a trick, ’ said Munnu commandingly. He told her about a man he had met on his rounds with his father, Chand Pasha, an old and ailing magician. Chand Pasha had taught Munnu an amazing trick and Munnu wanted to use it to make Mumtaz cheer up. Mumtaz fetched the chadar. It had been her grandmother’s last gift to her, embroidered with her own hands. The work was beautiful—even the bakhia on the edges, the fine little running stitches, were perfect.‘Close your eyes and hold on to one end of the chadar. I will take the other end. Now take a deep breath, and think hard about what you want, ’ Munnu said. Mumtaz thought about flying high above the clouds to visit new lands, see new people. She felt she was running like the bakhia, faster, faster … and even faster. Lotan picked up one end of the chadar in his beak, and Lakka the other, so she and Munnu rose above the ground, and into the skies.They flew to a faraway land. The mountains were blue, the skies were blue and filled with many kinds of birds. Below them was a green valley of fruitladen trees and flowerfilled gardens. Lotan and Lakka landed near a turquoisecoloured lake. By the lake, hunched over their work, were a group of men wearing warm phirans. They were embroidering woollen shawls, using very fine needles. The designs they stitched were motifs from the landscape around them —colourful flowers and leaves and birds.The eldest among them, Khurshid, greeted Mumtaz and asked where she was from. ‘Lucknow, ’ said Mumtaz. ‘I am a chikankar. ’ Khurshid showed her the shawl he was embroidering. ‘Look, ’ he said, ‘I have put all the birds and flowers of Kashmir into my shawl. Here is the gulistan, which means eye of flowers, and here are the bulbuls. This is the chashme bulbul, which means the eye of a bulbul. Just as a bulbul can see all around it, so this stitch looks the same from all sides! ’ He showed her how it was done. Mumtaz’s nimble fingers worked on the shawl as she learnt the new stitch. Khurshid offered Mumtaz and Munnu some hot Kashmiri tea and freshlybaked bread. He told them how many years ago Kashmiri artists had gone to the courts of the nawabs in Lucknow and worked with the chikankars there.After a while, Lotan and Lakka returned, and bidding goodbye to their new friends, Mumtaz and Munnu flew back to Lucknow. Before they knew it, they were back in Abida Khala’s house. Munnu had to rush off as his father was calling. Mumtaz busied herself with her embroidery, her head full of the new designs she had seen. In a few days she created a marvellous kurta full of birds and creepers and flowers. At the centre of each motif was the chashmebulbul.All the other women saw the piece and were amazed at the wonderful embroidery and imaginative designs. Instead of being happy that their cousin could create something so beautiful, Mehru and Kamru were jealous. ‘How does Mumtaz know such designs? She does not go out anywhere, does not see anything, yet she makes these fine designs in such beautiful colours, ’ said Mehru. ‘There must be something we can do to stop her from getting all this praise, ’ said Kamru.The sisters thought hard. One evening, when Mumtaz had gone to fetch food for Lakka and Lotan, Mehru hid all the coloured fabric that Mumtaz had been given to embroider, leaving only the white fabric. She also took away all Mumtaz’s coloured thread. ‘Ha! ’ said Mehru. ‘Let’s see if she can still win praise! ’ The following day, Munnu found Mumtaz sitting sadly next to her birds. She told him how she had only white fabric to embroider. White was considered the most difficult colour to work on as it got dirty easily. ‘And what designs will I do without coloured thread? ’ she asked sadly. ‘Cheer up! ’ said Munnu. ‘Get your nani’s chadar and think deeply. See what magical land you might find today! ’ This time, Mumtaz and Munnu flew to a land without colour. It was an ancient land, filled with people walking or riding in fine carriages. But there was one thing very strange about the land. Everyone wore only white—smooth, fine, radiant white. And there was very fine embroidery on their clothes. Under a neem tree by the wide road, Mumtaz saw her grandmother. With a cry of joy, Mumtaz ran to her.Nani hugged and kissed Mumtaz. ‘Why are you sad, Mumtaz? ’ she asked. ‘Coloured fabric was not meant for chikan work at all. Traditionally, the fabric for embroidery was always white mulmul, since it was meant mainly for men. Now, since women also wear it, people embroider on different kinds of coloured fabrics. But the best chikan work is done with white thread on a white mulmul ground. That is the heart and soul of chikan, the greatest test of a needlewoman’s skill. ’When Mumtaz came back, she took a large piece of fabric and began to embroider flowers using white thread. The leaves resembled the mangoes of Hardoi and the almonds of Kashmir. She created an elegant peacock in the midst of flowering bushes. The whole chadar was magical! Everyone was entranced by Mumtaz’s creation. All the wholesalers and chikankars talked of the fine work done by a young girl from Hardoi. Some rich ladies came to Abida Khala’s house and asked for Mumtaz’s embroidery to display in an exhibition they were organizing. All this made Kamru and Mehru even more envious. They wondered how they could stop Mumtaz from getting so famous, and hit upon a new plan. All the designs are usually printed on the fabric with washable ink. After the chikankars embroider these, the fabric is washed to remove the pattern.Kamru and Mehru refused to get fabric printed for Mumtaz. But that did not stop her. Mumtaz’s head was so full of all the beautiful things she had seen in her dreams that she did not need any other designs. One day, Mumtaz heard wonderful news. The wonderful chadar she had created on the white fabric had won an award! Mumtaz was invited to go to the town hall to receive her award. She asked Kamru and Mehru to come with her. They were ashamed of their ill will when they saw how happy she was.At the awards ceremony, Kamru and Mehru saw with what respect people treated Mumtaz. Some people even congratulated them for having such a talented cousin. After they came home, Kamru asked Mumtaz, ‘Where did you get all these wonderful designs? ’ Mumtaz was quiet for a while. Then she thought, I should share my good fortune. So she smiled and invited Kamru to hold on to her nani’s chadar and think deeply. Kamru did so, looking a bit puzzled. All she could see were Munia, Lakka and Lotan up to their usual antics.About the illustrations The ancient art of paper cutting is practised in the cities of Mathura and Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh. Traditionally, fine tree bark was used, though now many varieties of paper are used as well. The elaborate designs are usually of religious scenes, flora and fauna, textile motifs and geometric patterns. This intricate paper craft is used to decorate idols in temples, create stencil pictures of gods on cloth or stencils for children. Coloured sheets or metallic paper is placed under the stencil to give colours or shine to the picture. Dastkari Haat Samiti is a large organization of Indian craftspeople, working to improve the social and economic status of people engaged in traditional handicraft skills. Local forms of painting and craftwork have been used to illustrate this series of four stories to encourage the sharing of varied cultural expressions. This work was made possible with the support of UNESCO, New Delhi.	./Story text files/164.txt	14008	22	5.911284599006388	1134	275	197	69.39698492462311	66	133	36	13.527638190954773	49	150	767	642	6	1.5807473084230526	1364	215
I could not believe my eyes when I saw her for the first time. ‘This is incredible! Such a tiny car. Yet it can seat four passengers, ’ I thought.I was sitting on a wall with my little sister Neeta, counting cars. I love cars. I dream of them. I can tell you the make of every vehicle on the road. Aren’t cars amazing? BRRMM BRMMM and you can go anywhere in them.Bright yellow, her headlights blinked. She looked like a red fairy. Questions whirled in my mind. Where did she live? What was her name? I needed to know more about her.I cycled to the colony gate. I asked Guard Chacha if he knew anything about this sparkling little red car. He laughed and said, “You like that car? That car and its owner have recently moved here. They live in house number .” “Thank you,” I said and cycled home again.That evening, I went to house number , looking for my new neighbour. I spotted big cars but the little red car wasn’t there. Then I saw a gate and behind the gate I saw Red Fairy.There was a cable attached to her left. Ooooo, Red Fairy moved with electricity, not petrol or diesel. She got herself charged to run around!The next day, I saw Red Fairy whizzing past. I ran behind her and raised my hand to stop her. She stopped! Sitting inside was a whitehaired lady who smiled at me. She looked like my Nani.I gently patted Red Fairy and told Nani, “I am a car expert but I have never seen a car like this. I really like her.” “I hope you will like me too,” said Nani. “Since Red Fairy and you live together, you must be very nice too,” I said, and couldn’t help but grin.“You have given this little one a wonderful name – Red Fairy,” said Nani. “And may I call you Red Fairy’s Nani?” I asked. I told her about my love of cars and motorcycles and about my photo collection.Nani said, “Red Fairy and I moved to the colony recently and do not know anyone here. I’m glad you stopped us.” “My name is Meeto. I will ask Ma to introduce you to our neighbours, but first tell me more about Red Fairy.”Nani offered to take me for a drive. I was so excited.I ran home and asked Ma for permission to go with Nani. Then I jumped into Red Fairy’s lap. Nani started her up and Red Fairy began to run. As we whizzed down the roads, I could hear no roar, only a purr. I asked Nani why the car was so quiet. She said, “Red Fairy makes no noise and emits no smoke.”Red Fairy zipped between cars – small cars and big cars. People on the road stared and smiled at us.At a red light, an auto rickshaw driver was curious about Red Fairy and asked Nani a lot of questions about her. The light turned green and we drove on, ahead of everyone. No BRRMM BRMMM noise, yet zooming away.Soon we were at India Gate. Nani bought ice creams for us. Everything was grey. Nani said it was the smog that made things grey.I told her that my papa said that the air in Delhi was very polluted. “The smoke that comes out of cars adds to this pollution, which is why my mother doesn’t like my interest in cars.”Nani listened as I shared stories with her. “My sister Neeta and I often get ill and catch colds and coughs because of the pollution. But I do love cars. What do I do?” I asked.Nani said she had been driving Red Fairy for eight years and they were good friends. Suddenly I felt that Red Fairy was whispering to me. “Meeto, I do not pollute the air like other cars do. Also, I take very little space to move and park.”I was now convinced that Red Fairy was magical. No smoke, no sound, no petrol and no diesel. And she was talking to me. “Cars that use alternative energy can reduce air pollution. Who knows, you could become a scientist and invent cars that cause no pollution at all,” said Nani.I decided that I would invent a new car and call it Vibgyor Fairy.Green Cars A green car is a car that is environmentally friendly. It consumes less or no petrol and emits little or no carbon dioxide. There are several kinds of green cars. Electric car: This runs on an electric motor and stores energy in large rechargeable batteries. Hybrid car: This has two motors, one electric and one internal combustion. It uses less petrol than regular cars and causes less pollution.Hydrogen car: This uses hydrogen for fuel instead of petrol. Instead of smoke, it produces water vapour which is great for the environment. Solar car: This uses solar energy for power. Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity to run the car. There are no exhaust fumes or emissions.	./Story text files/450.txt	4430	18	5.482617586912065	413	76	114	47.69230769230769	53	38	23	10.164835164835164	36	55	295	194	6	1.4166666666666667	494	58
"Papa took Pattu’s report card from Ms Anuradha like it was a big box of sweets – with a big smile to match.Last time, Pattu had made a paper plane out of his report card. He said he sent it flying home – it never got there. Wonder why?Maybe the sparrow in the tree could tell you what a warm nest it made. Or the peanut seller could tell you what a nice cone it made.So this time, Papa went with Pattu to get his report card from the teacher himself. Papa looked at Pattu’s report card. His smile went from a slice of papaya to the thin wedge of a lime. out of  for Reading. Papa’s eyebrows dashed together like colliding bulls.  out of  for Recitation. He shook his head from side to side, like a tree in a storm.  out of  for Spelling. He let out a long whoosh, which sounded like a train engine.As they walked home, Papa thought, “This report card needs to be made not into a paper plane, but into a rocket and launched far, far away. What will Pattu’s Mummy say? She always used to come first in her class.”Just then, Pattu’s friend Shambavi came running and gave Pattu a toffee. “This is for sharing your pencils with me yesterday, when I forgot to bring one,” said Shambavi. “No wonder Pattu comes home with no pencils,” thought Papa.On the way home, a bunch of dogs ran alongside them, wagging their tails happily. Pattu bent down and patted their heads. “I. . . er. . . I give Kalu, Chintu and Bintu a few puris from my lunchbox,” he said. “And your mummy is so happy you are asking for extra puris,” thought Papa, “If only she knew where they disappeared!”Pattu and Papa were almost home, when their neighbour Das Uncle called out from his garden, ""Hello Pattu, I don’t need medicines today. "" Papa wondered, “We don’t need medicines as well. Why is he talking about medicines?” Das Uncle said, “I ask your son to buy medicines from the corner shop for me. He always brings back exact change. You must be proud of him.”At home, Mummy came out and asked, “How is Pattu’s report card?” Papa closed his eyes, and said, “It was a big, big shock!” Pattu’s face was as small as a crushed grape.“ out of  for sharing,” said Papa. “ out of  for kindness.  out of  for respect.”Pattu’s face was like an orange and Mummy’s like a watermelon – both bright and full of joy.Mummy sat down with Pattu. “This is my real report card,” Pattu said. Mummy smiled. “ out of  for honesty. No one could get a better report card.”"	./Story text files/246.txt	2416	18	5.3610108303249095	243	34	138	47.34	27	23	27	10.24	24	26	175	102	4	1.3140243902439024	311	17

Her chosen career is as a professional pilot, she has worked in a variety of aviation capacities from instruction to airline flying, and is the author of several aviation text books. Danielle started writing children's books as a creative outlet from the stress of her 'day job' and as a break from the sometimes monotonous work required for her professional writing. She began with the Mac and Dipper series, aimed at  year olds, inspired by two of her own dogs. After having a child of her own, she suddenly found she had a muse, an eager resource for test reading, and, by benefit of her age, an honest critic all in one. It was fun and rewarding to write creative stories which matched her daughters learning curve. A series of 'junior' books aimed at young children and children learning to read followed. Encouraged by friends and family, and already familiar with the selfpublishing route through her nonfiction books, Danielle began publishing the books online so that others could enjoy them too. Because of her passion for children's literature and the role it plays in improved literacy standards, all of Danielle's own books are available for free download and may be used free of charge for noncommercial purposes.MORE BOOKS!

"Amma! There is a bat in my sambar! Eesh! I do not want her in there.I know you told me to shut the windows tight. But I forgot this one on the right!Phew! The bat has stopped swimming in my food. She seems to be in a very bad mood.She is flying in circles around my face, Flapping her wings, making my heart race.Watch out! Hide! Run for your life! She's dropping poop bombs. They are not very nice.""Suppi, relax"" Amma whispers, ""I think she wants to go back to her brothers and sisters. ""Amma turns off the fan and all the lights. I open the windows and don’t put up a fight.Amma is right!

Have you ever seen a bat flying about and felt scared? Did you think the bat was going to sleep in your hair for the night? Bats are not at all interested in hanging upside down from your hair. They would rather rest their feet in the branches of a tree or the roof of a cave or the wall of a building! If a bat comes into your house, don’t get frightened.

Dear… well, you know who you are. And it’s not like you’re ever going to see this letter. Miss told me that I had to be your mentor and show you around because you are a new student. I didn’t know what a ‘mentor’ is, so I looked it up in the dictionary. Anyway, she didn’t tell me anything about that. Ali and Gaurav and Sumi and Rani, they kept asking me about it when we were going home from school. I told them that I didn’t know what they were talking about, but that’s not true. How can I not know? See, you made me lie to my friends. Yours sincerely, MeHi again, Ma says that it is not good to stare at people, but I can see that everyone stares at you. They stare at me too because I have to hang around with you and be your ‘mentor’. Why did you come to our school? Why couldn’t you continue going to whatever school you went to earlier? Do you know what happened yesterday? Gaurav, Ali and two of their friends from Class VII cornered me after school to ask about youknow what. They took my bag and wouldn’t give it back. Then they threw it into the thicket by the side of the road and I had to scramble down into the mountainside to get it. I tore my shirt and Ma was angry with me. This is all your fault. MeHello, I keep telling them that they can ask you whatever they want to know. What’s the point of asking me? How am I supposed to know why you have that thing or how it works? To be really honest, I can’t say I’m not curious myself or that I don’t have the same questions the others are asking me. Yes, I noticed it the first day when you came into the classroom. I saw how you did everything with one hand and how your left hand never moved. At first I couldn’t tell what the problem was. Then, when I came closer, I saw that something wasn’t quite right. It looked weird, like it was covered in plastic or something. Then I thought it was a toy hand. It took me some time to understand. Also, I saw what happened at lunch. See you, MeHello, My oldest sister, the one who’s studying engineering in Delhi, called today. I told her, “There’s a girl in my class and she has a fake hand,” and she said that the term is “prosthetic hand” . Listen, I have some advice for you. You may be new and all, but if you want people to stop staring at you and talking about you, you have to stop standing in the corner all the time. Why don’t you play with us? Why don’t you come on the swing? Everyone loves the swing. It’s been two weeks, and you can jolly well come by yourself. I am not going to be your minder for ever. Sometimes I don’t know what to say to you. MeHi again, After the lunch incident that day, I’ve been watching you. I’m just curious. Is it weird to have one hand? Is it only your hand or is your entire arm fake, sorry, prosthetic? Today, Sumi, Gaurav and I walked to school together. They were playing a game they made up called OneHand Challenge. The rule is, you have to do things with one hand. Like, packing your bag or buttoning your shirt.Sumi couldn’t tie her shoelaces and she forgot about it and tripped and fell. She got a cut on her chin. Miss saw it and, even though she put some antiseptic cream on it, she scolded Sumi for being careless. “You can’t run around in the mountains with your shoelaces untied. What will happen if you fall while going home or something?” I think adults worry too much. Yours truly, MeHi, Do you know what a coincidence is? It’s like when you talk about something and the same thing happens sometime later in a completely unrelated way. In my last letter, I was telling you about Sumi and the shoelaces, and then, today, I saw you tying your shoelaces. Wow, that was awesome! I think you did it faster than I can do it with two hands. If you were my friend, I would challenge you to a shoelacetying race. Or no, maybe I would ask you to teach me how to do it with one hand. I have to confess, I did try to tie my shoelace with one hand when I got home. But it’s impossible. How do you do it? Maybe I’ll ask you tomorrow. Curious, MeHi, So, after what you said, I’ve tried to do a lot of things with only one hand, but it’s so difficult! I still don’t get how you do it, like having a bath, wearing your clothes, packing your bag. Since that day at lunch, I did realize that you have to do some things differently, but it’s not like you don’t do almost everything the rest of us do. Listen, I’m sorry about what I said earlier. . . about playing with us. I guess you were just feeling shy. And also about coming on the swing. I tried and it’s hard to get your balance if you don’t hold it with two hands. But you’re great in the jungle gym, even if you don’t hang from the bars, and you can run really fast, even faster than Ali, who won the first prize at Sports Day. Bye, MeHello! That movie was really funny, no? I laughed so much that my stomach hurt and it was like I was crying. I always like it when they show movies in school. It means no classes. Last time, before you came to our school, they showed this movie about a tiger cub who got lost. It was quite scary, mostly because it was a true story. Later someone found it and managed to get it back to its family. True stories like that are called documentaries, did you know that? Tiger cubs are cute, no? Last year, there was a puppy near our house. It was very cute too, but it grew up and then it wasn’t so cute any more. Got to go now! MeHello, hello! Did you know? I was so surprised when I saw you on the bus. I had no idea my father worked in the same place as yours! But I’m so happy you came for the office picnic, because last year when they took us, there were no other children my age and I got really bored. Okay, I’m really tired, so I’m going now. See you in school tomorrow. MeHi, I think I should warn you, Principal Sir becomes slightly insane whenever Annual Day comes along. He might yell at you — he yells at everyone — so don’t take it personally. My ma says that he’s under a lot of pressure because our Annual Day performance reflects on him. I’m not sure what that means, but he does look stressed out. Did you see his hair? It was like he touched a loose wire and got an electric shock! Though I think it was very mean of Rani to put a frog in his chair. Okay, I’m going now before he catches me writing this letter! MeHey, Your new hand is so cool! No offence, but the old one was a bit boring. It was just… there. The new one is like magic, and you can move the fingers and grip with it! I hope you didn’t mind that I asked to shake hands. I just said it before I could think. Maybe tomorrow we can do some experiments to find out if you can lift stuff with it. Oh! I just realized, the last couple of letters I wrote to you, I didn’t mention your prosthetic hand at all. It’s like I forgot all about it and wanted to tell you so many other things. The funny thing is, I’m not that curious about your hand any more. I don’t know why. Your friend, MeTHE FRIENDOMETER QUIZ How good are you at helping people fit in?

“ “What’s for supper?” asked Sam. “It’s a surprise” , said Mama, putting a big pot on the stove.She added a jug of water. Sam was worried. “Are we having water for supper?” he wailed. “It’s a surprise. Wait and see.” replied Mama.“You are still a bit short,” said Mama. “The pot might fall over. But you can help me by fetching things.” “Can I help?” asked Sam. “I could stir.”“Can you bring me an onion, please.” “This doesn’t smell very nice.” “They will taste nice once they are cooked.”“Now I need some tomatoes. No, that is an apple. The tomatoes are also round and red, but you will find them in the fridge.”“Can you bring me potatoes. They are round and brown.” “Is supper ready yet?”“If you are hungry you can eat the apple while you wait.” “What about these?” “No, we won’t need biscuits. We can save those for after supper.”“What’s in the pot?” “It’s a surprise. Wait and see.”“What about this?” “That is a watermelon. It will be too big for the pot.” “See if you can find some spinach. It is also green.”“Please get some bread. No, it won’t go into the pot but on the table.”Mama carried the pot to the table and started to dish up. “What’s in the pot?” asked Sam.“Soup!” My favourite!	./Story text files/469.txt	1196	15	5.7317073170731705	96	27	74	25.6	41	4	16	5.866666666666666	37	8	77	46	4	1.1604938271604939	156	6
It is a lovely day in June. Meera Miss is busy. She has told the children to play on their own. Stella and Parvez are having fun drawing on the blackboard.KUOOOOH KUOOOH! “Koel?” asks Parvez. “Yes, but it seems to have a sore throat! I’ve never seen a koel with a sore throat before. Come, let’s go look for it!” says Stella.Stella and Parvez run towards the trees. “This pit is too deep! I can’t jump over it!” says Stella. Parvez holds her hand and they leap across.“Kuooo, Kuooo!” calls out Stella. “Kkk . . . kkkuh . . . ooh!” whispers Parvez. They look everywhere. But they can’t find the bird with the sore throat.Soon, all their classmates join them in their search. KUOOOO KUOOOO! Everybody wants to see the koel with the sore throat.“There!” says Bhanu. “No, no, here!” says Zeba softly. “I can see one on that branch!” points out Uma. “Parvez, look up . . . on that tree!” says Karan. “Oh no, now how do we know which one has a sore throat?” asks Zeba.TUN TUNN TUNN TUN “Lunch time!” yells Bhanu.Parvez can feel his stomach growling. “What is that sound!” jokes Stella. They run inside and open their lunch boxes. “Idli, yay!” says Stella happily. “Mmmm . . . papaa . . . th . . . thaa!” mumbles Parvez, munching a paratha.TUNTUNTUNTUN TUNNN! Parvez picks up his bag and runs to Amina Dadi. She Lunch break is over. is waiting near the gate.“Parvez, you’re not wearing your hearingaid! You know it will help you hear better, dear,” she says. She pulls out the small machine from his shirt pocket and fixes it to his ear.“I dddon't lllike it,” he mutters. “And I don't like my glasses, but I wear them, don't I?” asks Dadi. Just then, he hears a koel faintly. “Kuooohoooh!” imitates Parvez with a giggle. “Ku ooooohooooooh!” Parvez tells Dadi about the koel with a sore throat as they walk towards Sukarna School for the Deaf.In the evening, he meets Stella near his house. “Sstellaa, I h . . . h . . . eard dhu koel!” he says, one word at a time. Stella waves both her hands in the air. It means she is clapping. Parvez has taught her many words in Sign Language that he has learnt from Sheela Miss at Sukarna School.“I ththink . . . itssss . . . ththroat . . . got better!” he says. Sheela Miss says his voice too will get better. It may just take a long time. “Catch?” calls Parvez, and off he runs. It is playtime now!SOME EARS ARE DIFFERENT  When Parvez was just five months old, his parents saw that he didn’t react to loud noises at all. They took him to a doctor who said that Parvez may have hearing loss. The doctor explained how they could help Parvez learn everything just like children who could hear.  When you can hear well, you learn to speak easily too. Most deaf people do not speak very well because they cannot hear others talk. People who have total hearing loss cannot hear anything. Parvez has partial hearing loss. So he needs a special teacher like Sheela Miss to help him learn sign language, lipreading, and other ways to communicate.  Some children wear glasses so that they can see better. Parvez wears a hearing aid so that he can hear better. He has to be careful with this little machine. Parvez understands people better when they speak to him softly, and if they are facing him when they talk. Parvez cannot hear well. But he can see, feel, smell, understand and learn very well, and play catch!	./Story text files/439.txt	3338	20	5.278772378516624	342	49	122	26.59504132231405	100	21	24	6.115702479338843	90	31	237	154	5	1.0796812749003983	478	24
When I woke up in the morning, the sun was shining again. I looked around me, wondering where I was. And then I remembered. I was a baby sea turtle  an olive ridley  in the middle of a big blue world, which I had heard someone call the ocean. There was blue and green water in every direction, and the sunlight was playing games with the clouds. I tucked my flippers beneath my body and floated for a while, letting the current carry me. I did not know where I was. But that does not matter when the sun is shining, and your stomach is full. The sun warmed me, and filled me with new energy.Just as I was beginning to think that I would love to spend the rest of my life here, a school of fish went by. Chasing them was a really big fish. I could tell he was a really hungry fish too. When he saw me, his eyes lit up. “Mmmmm,” he seemed to be thinking, “baby turtle soup!” Moments later, I was swimming as fast as I could, with those big teeth snapping at my little hind flippers. Just when I was beginning to tire, I saw a seaweed raft. A seaweed raft is just that, a floating mass of seaweed and driftwood that travels around the ocean, carried along by the current. On and in the raft are the Drifters, all the sea’s little and notsolittle creatures that float around the ocean, waiting for something to happen. Gratefully, I slipped into the raft. I would not leave this safe haven for many, many years. Being on the raft was like going on a world cruise. I enjoyed it very much, but as I grew up, I decided it was time to explore the big wide world outside the raft.I had heard wonderful things about a place called the Reef where a lot of other turtles lived. Everyone said the Reef was the fairyland of the ocean. They said it was full of beautiful, brightlycoloured creatures, both harmless ones like the clown fish and poisonous ones like the scorpion fish. I wondered how I would find it.All of a sudden, it became very dark. A huge shadow covered me. Frightened, I looked up, only to see the biggest turtle I had ever seen. His back was soft and leathery. I stared. A turtle with a soft back? All the ones I know have very hard backs. The big turtle caught me staring. “Surprised?” he grunted pleasantly. “You shouldn’t be. I’m a leatherback turtle.”“Good name, Sir,” I mumbled. “Where are you going, Sir?” I continued. “To the Reef to live with the other turtles?” “Ah,” sighed the leatherback. “I wish I had that luxury. But no, I am too busy searching for jellyfish. They are all I eat.” “Where do you find them?” I asked.“Out in the deep, deep, sea,” said the leatherback. “Sometimes I have to dive more than a  feet to reach them. And sometimes I go all the way to Canada, where the water gets very cold. No other reptile could survive in such cold waters.” “If it isn’t too rude, Sir,” I said quietly, “can I ask how much you weigh?” “Nearly  kilograms, little one,” replied the leatherback, looking amused. “And I’m proud of all of it, including the fat. For it’s the fat that helps me get through the long migrations. Well, I have to be off now. . .”“Of course, Sir,” I said. “But before you go, could you tell me where I might find the Reef?” “That way,” said the leatherback, pointing with a flipper as he swam off. “Thank you, Sir, and happy hunting!” I called out as I swam towards the reef.It was on the Reef that I met old Green Turtle. My friend Hawksbill, whose mouth is curved like a hawk’s beak, told me old Green was nearly  years old. “My! That’s old!” I said. “How come she looks so young?” “Well,” said Hawksbill, “Green Turtle eats only sea grass and algae, so it took her nearly  years to become an adult. You and I will be adults by the time we are ten.”“Do you know,” he continued, “that when she wants to nest, she migrates to islands in the middle of the ocean? Clear blue lagoons, white sand, they’re beautiful. . .” “Have you been there?” I asked. “Oh yes, sometimes you have to crawl over the coral to get to the beach,” said Hawksbill. ​I shuddered. I would hate to crawl over sharp coral. Soft sand is what I like under my soft belly. “You won’t have to do it, don’t worry,” another ridley told me. “We only nest on soft beaches, like the ones on the coasts of Mexico, Costa Rica, and India. But you’ll see for yourself, when it’s time. . .”“How will I know it’s time?” I asked eagerly as she swam away. “You will, trust me,” was all she would say.I spent some happy years on the Reef, meeting many of my turtle cousins. Apart from green turtles and hawksbills, I met loggerhead turtles  the ones with the really big heads  and plenty of other ridleys like me. And then one day, just like that, I was all grown up, and it was time to go. How did I know it was time? I don’t know. Something deep inside me told me so. I knew I had to swim north with all the other ridleys, all along the eastern coast of India until we reached Orissa, and lay my eggs on the soft beaches there. The little compass in my head would tell me how to get there.“It’s only about  kilometers,” sniffed a loggerhead as he swam off in a different direction. Show off! Just because loggerheads like him sometimes swim almost  kilometres to lay their eggs (from California, all the way across the Pacific Ocean to Japan)! I ignored him, and continued gorging on flying fish, my favourite food. The big journey began. The water around me was full of other ridleys like me, swimming powerfully.It wasn’t an easy journey. Along the way, there were many dangers. Though I was now bigger than most of the fish, there were still sharks that could catch us.But the sharks were not as dangerous as the many fishing nets that we had to swim past. I swam as carefully as I could, avoiding all the nets, especially the terrible trawl nets. I managed to escape them all, but some of my friends weren’t so lucky. Finally, I reached the beach of Gahirmatha, the place where more ridleys nested than anywhere else in the Indian Ocean. It was time to lay my first nest.We always nest at night. I waited until the tide was a little high, so that I wouldn’t have that far to crawl on the beach. I came in with the surf, and felt land under me for the first time since my birth. It felt very strange at first. Slowly, I dragged myself up the beach to find a dry spot.Once I had moved past the hightide line, the sand became very dry and flew all around me as I dragged myself forward with my front flippers. It is very difficult to move on land. I paused to take a breath and looked up. The beach was long and dark.Behind the beach was a huge dune and some bushes. I had heard there was a large forest behind this beach called Bhitarkanika which was full of saltwater crocodiles, king cobras and all kinds of other animals. Then, suddenly, I saw another animal on the beach. It had four legs and it was digging up a turtle nest. I went back into the water as fast as I could. Later that night, I crawled up again, and went up the beach into the Ipomea creepers. At my chosen spot on the beach, I cleared away the dry sand, and made a big pit with my hind flippers. I am very fussy about how exactly I do this. I always put one flipper in after the other, scoop up some sand and throw it out.About two feet deep and shaped like a flask, with a narrow neck leading into a deep cavity, it was a beauty. I then began laying my eggs. , , , . . . , , , . . . , ,  and then I was done. I covered my precious eggs carefully with sand, and thumped it down with my body. Finally I threw some sand around to make sure that no one would find my nest. Quickly, quickly, I crawled back into the sea where I felt much safer.Two weeks later, I was getting ready to nest again. We usually make enough eggs to lay two or three nests during a season. My common sense told me that it would be a good idea to nest again where I had the previous time. It seemed like a good, safe place. That night, as I was waiting in the shallow water for the tide to be right, I noticed a slight change in the wind. It was stronger and blowing from a different direction. Suddenly I realised that there were hundreds, no, thousands, of other turtles all waiting to nest. I knew a lot of other ridleys were also swimming around in the Gahirmatha waters waiting to nest, but I had never seen so many together.And then, we were all rushing up the beach together. The beach was already full. There were thousands of other ridleys, sand was flying in the air, we were all bumping into each other. Finally, I managed to find a clear spot, and dig a nest for myself. The turtle next to me was in such a hurry, she started to lay her eggs even before she could finish digging her nest. I was shocked, we turtles never do that.“It’s an arribada*, lady,” she said, “we all get a little crazy during this time.” Nobody really knows why we do this. But it works for us, because millions of hatchlings hatch at the same time. That way, most of the little ones escape being caught by birds, crabs and jackals. These days, of course, we have humans to worry about as well. * During an arribada  which means ‘arrival’ in Spanish  thousands of olive ridleys come ashore in a frenzy to nest. Scientists still aren’t sure why they do this.Finally, it is time to leave and return to my feeding ground. I will spend a year or two there, eating and building up the energy for another visit to Gahirmatha. Green Turtle, on the other hand, sometimes needs to eat for five or six years before she has the energy to make her next journey to nest. As I leave, I think of the little ones I have left behind. For  to  days, the eggs will remain under the sand, warmed by the sun. And then one day, they will hatch, breaking open their shells with the tips of their snouts. They will huddle together, over a hundred hatchlings under the sand, waiting for the sun to set and the sand to cool. Then, in the darkness, when it is safe, they will come out, all at once. They will see the moonlight bouncing off the sea, and know which way to go. Hopefully they will be no streetlights to make them go in the wrong direction.They will swim against the waves and dive under the oncoming breakers.Oh, there will be big fish and small fish out to get them, and seagulls and eagles, but some will get away. Out into the open sea where they will find their own little seaweed rafts, their floating homes for many years. Then they will grow up, and perhaps they will come to my feeding ground. Perhaps we will meet, though of course I will not know them. Still, I am happy knowing that they are out there somewhere, and that someday they will return like me to this very beach to lay their own eggs, and start the whole wonderful circle of life all over again.A MESSAGE FROM THE OLIVE RIDLEY TO YOU Sea turtles are in danger worldwide, for many reasons. Some species of turtles are killed for their meat, which is used to make turtle soup. The shell of the hawksbill turtle is used to make tortoiseshell products like eyeglass frames and hair accessories. Many turtle eggs and hatchlings are eaten by predators like dogs and crows. But the biggest danger comes from fishing. Many sea turtles get accidentally caught in a variety of fishing nets, drown, and die. In India, there are many conservation groups that are trying to save sea turtles. Each coastal state has one or more such groups.What can YOU do to protect sea turtles? If you live near a beach where turtles come to nest: • Help keep the beach clean so that baby and mother turtles do not get hurt. • Educate the adults in your locality about how streetlights and other lights near the beach can be harmful to turtle hatchlings – once they hatch, hatchlings figure out where the sea is by looking for the reflection of moonlight on water, so if there are other bright lights in the area, they can get confused and wander off in the wrong direction, and into danger. • Find out if your state has a local sea turtle conservation group and see if you can join them. If you don’t live near a beach: Read more and more about sea turtles and talk to everyone you know about the dangers they are facing. Spreading awareness is a BIG part of conservation.	./Story text files/328.txt	12127	16	5.635090609555189	1023	191	366	61.51546391752577	89	105	67	12.907216494845361	65	129	827	387	5	1.3609898107714702	1241	133

Tara could not sit still! The train seemed to be going very slowly. Tara peered out through the window. Lights winked from windows in tall buildings. As everyone in the bogey prepared to sleep, one passenger asked Tara, “Beti, I hope you are not running away from home?” “No, no!” said Tara. Early in the morning, Tara got off the train at Meenapur.She walked towards the banks of the river Ganga and got into a crowded boat. “Who could this girl be, travelling all alone?” wondered many people on the boat. As Tara got out, the boatman asked, “Have you run away from home?” Tara smiled and said, “No, no, sir, I am going home!”Tara came to a forest. She took out her camera. A deer looked at her and seemed to be asking what she was doing there! Tara aimed her camera and clicked. “I’ve come home, dear deer, I’ve come home to the village of my ancestors.”As the sun set, Tara started walking on a rope bridge. The bridge swung gently with her steps. She smiled as she thought of what awaited her on the other side.Once on the other side, Tara stopped to take out her map and plan her way forward. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Ah, the earthy smell of green trees and plants in this forest was lovely!Tara made a small bonfire. She ate some food that she had packed and settled down under the sky. Stars twinkled like friends. Tomorrow she would cross the forest by foot, and then take a bus to the village where her great grandparents lived. For today, Tara Prakash, famous wildlife photographer, was just going to sleep under the stars and dream about home.Dear Reader, Have you tried counting the stars? How many stars do you think you can count? If you had to stay alone in a forest, name some of the things that you should have with you. Which are the days in a month when stars are most visible to the eye? Why?	./Story text files/367.txt	1832	13	5.561497326203209	163	24	119	51.371428571428574	19	16	23	10.742857142857142	15	20	123	64	4	1.3627906976744186	201	14
“Janice, wake up!” Grandma calls. Janice jumps out of bed. Today is her last day at Grandma Liu’s house.Janice had promised her family in Mumbai that she would bring back gifts. But she has not bought anything yet! “Grandma Liu, can you please take me shopping?” Janice asks. Grandma Liu lives in Tiretti Bazaar in Kolkata. It is also known as Chinatown.Janice and Grandma Liu set off to explore Chinatown. Rickshaws zigzag. Their wooden wheels go clacketyclack. Their bells go jinglejangle. The air smells good enough to eat.The first stop is Mr. Lee’s. “Mr. Lee, I am going home to Mumbai tomorrow. What can I take back?” “How about these purple plum candies?” “Mmmm! Sweet and tangy!” says Janice. “My brother will love them.”The next stop is Mrs. Chen’s shop. “Mrs. Chen, I am going home to Mumbai tomorrow. What can I take back?” “How about this black fungus? Put some in soup and it will cure sniffles.” “Oooo! That looks like a huge black ear!” says Janice. “My mother will love it.”Off to Mrs. Wong’s shop. “Mrs. Wong, I am going home to Mumbai tomorrow. What can I take back?” “How about this beautiful lantern?” “It is the colour of gulmohar flowers” says Janice, “My father will love it.”The shopping is done, and Janice is hungry! Grandma Liu buys dumpling soup and baozi buns. Slurrrp! “This is delicious,” Janice says.Janice and Grandma stop at a temple. It smells like incense. “When people pass away,” Grandma Liu says, “they turn into spirits. We seek their blessings before we go on a journey.”At a table in a big hall, people are playing mahjong. The tiles go clickclack! “The tiles are dragons and wind and flowers,” Grandma says. “That is a lot more exciting than hopscotch squares!” says Janice.On the way back home, Janice sees a woman reading a newspaper. “Is that in Chinese?” Janice asks. “Yes!” Grandma Liu says. “This is the only Chinese newspaper in India. You can only find it here in Kolkata.”At home, Janice starts packing all her gifts. “Janice, you have bought gifts for everyone else, but what will you take back?” asks Grandma Liu. “Our memories, Grandma,” Janice says. “They were the best gift of all!”	./Story text files/292.txt	2139	16	5.812244897959184	199	46	78	30.014492753623188	59	10	15	6.3478260869565215	49	20	120	125	4	1.2712418300653594	282	24
Meet Miss Bandicota Miss Bandicota Bengalensis was a little Indian mole rat who grew up in a maze of burrows with her mother, seven sisters and ten brothers. They were terrific pests, the nineteen of them, always out on a rampage. Most of the Bengalensis family went out to nearby farms to forage for food. But after she narrowly escaped a farmer’s rat trap, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis decided never to attack a farm. “Whatever else can you do?” her mother had asked. Miss Bandicota Bengalensis had smiled simply and said, “I can burrow.”So every night she would start digging a tunnel. And every morning, she found herself somewhere different, in search of a new adventure, friends and food. Once, she ended up on the beach of Bordi, where she met Porpita porpita and sand bubbler crabs. She also saw the sea for the first time. Wherever she went, so did her explorer’s kit with sunglasses, binoculars, magnifying glass and, of course, her favourite – sticker bandages. Let’s explore another part of India with Miss Bandicota!Somebody stuck her tiny nose out of a hole in the ground. Who was that? Miss Bandicota Bengalensis! She had just emerged from a new burrow after a long night of digging through layers and layers of pink, white and brown rock. It was nearly sunrise. Just as she was about to set her sunglasses on top of her nose, she caught a fleeting glimpse of something odd.She rushed back into her burrow, only to raise her head again more cautiously. She peered nervously into what looked like a round glass window encircled in a thick black rim. From behind it, a huge black eye peered back at her.Miss Bandicota Bengalensis couldn’t believe her eyes. Could it be a. . . magnifying glass? Before she could say anything to the huge black eye, it asked, “Who are you?” in a gentle human voice. “I’m Miss Bandicota Bengalensis. Who are you?”“I’m Tiku, an explorer,” said the human child, moving back one step. The boy was smiling at Miss Bandicota Bengalensis. Not too big, not too small – he looked just right to be an explorer. “I have set out to roam the Bhimbetka Hills today,” he said proudly. Miss Bandicota Bengalensis examined the green cap on his head, the pair of binoculars slung around his neck, the brown backpack hanging from his shoulders and the large magnifying glass in his hand. Tiku was all set. She nodded in approval.So she said eagerly, holding up her magnifying glass and travel kit, “I love exploring too! I make burrows that go to new places.” Tiku grinned. “I know a secret trail through this forest. Do you want to come along?” As you might have guessed, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis was always up for anything new.She scurried out of her burrow. The two new friends began their journey, treading on a narrow, dusty path.It was winter; the forest was dry and bare. Leafless branches cast a faint web of shadows that quivered in the breeze.Miss Bandicota Bengalensis hopped lightly from one shadow to another. She would land gingerly on her toes, so as not to disturb the patterns of light and shade. Now and again, she turned around to make sure that the wooded patterns had reappeared on the ground. The chilly morning breeze brushed softly by them. A pair of hornbills were calling in duet, their cries piercing through the silence. As they climbed ahead, the road grew steeper but they kept up a steady pace. Soft rustling on their right brought them to a halt. A strange animal crossed their path; it looked a bit like a cow, and bit like an antelope. It was tall and seemed strong. It had bluishgrey skin, two curved horns between its ears, a distinctive white patch at its throat and a small black beard below it.“What's that?” whispered Miss Bandicota Bengalensis. “Nilgai,” said Tiku, his eyes shining. Before Miss Bandicota Bengalensis could ask any more questions, the nilgai vanished as suddenly as it had appeared.The quiet of the jungle was rudely interrupted by a crash of branches. And cacophony. Startled, mole rat and boy hesitated. Then they proceeded cautiously. The source of the din was not very far off. Actually, it seemed to be coming from just above! A wild fruit tree was the centre of the rowdy racket. The drooping branches were laden with large, round fruits.The ground below was covered with more ripe yellow green ones. Many had burst open. The soft pulp was a brilliant saffron. A sweet scent filled the cove. “What tree is this?” Miss Bandicota Bengalensis shouted out to the noisy langurs. “This is a bael tree. Don’t you know it?” said an elderlylooking langur, surprised by the question. “We Indian langurs have been feasting on its fruit for thousands of years.” Miss Bandicota Bengalensis shook her head, for she had never tasted bael before. “Well, never mind, jump right in,” he offered. “There's plenty for everybody!”Miss Bandicota Bengalensis pounced on it, prying open the cracked woody shell with gusto. Tiku busied himself collecting dried leaves while she gorged on the fruit. Refreshed by their break, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis and Tiku hiked up the mountain path with renewed vigour. As they climbed, the forest cleared.Further ahead, the road wound through a rocky terrain of sandstone and quartzite. A giant boulder stood precariously at the bend. A lone shimul tree towered over from behind. Its prickly trunk spread out young silvery branches. It had shed most of its leaves. Deep crimson flowers had just begun to bloom. “I must have a fresh shimul flower for my collection,” announced Miss Bandicota Bengalensis's explorer friend. Promptly, they both rushed to scale the boulder.As Tiku leaned over to take hold of the lowest branch, he slipped, and with him went Miss Bandicota Bengalensis. They rolled down the boulder and slid down the dusty slope. BUMP. . . BUMP. . . BUMPITY. . . BUMP.The poor boy had scraped his knee and was clutching his leg in pain. Miss Bandicota Bengalensis was beside him in a flash, a sticker bandage ready in hand. Tiku thanked her as he stuck it on. Dusting themselves, they both stood up, giggling at the silly accident. As Miss Bandicota Bengalensis turned towards the road, her eyes fell upon a breathtaking sight.“Look! We have discovered the largest burrow in the world,” she said, awestruck. Tiku smiled affectionately and patted Miss Bandicota Bengalensis on her back. “Welcome to the caves of Bhimbetka!” She couldn’t contain her excitement. Or wait to explore the mysterious caves. Most of all, she was brimming with questions – “Who made these caves? When did they make them? How did they make them? Who lives in them?”“One at a time, my dear friend,” said Tiku, laughing as they entered the caves. Inside, another surprise awaited them. The walls had paintings of strange animals and sticklike men. They seemed to tell a story from long, long ago. Once again, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis looked up at her friend questioningly. And so he told her the story of the old caves. “A very, very long time ago, layers and layers of limestone and sandstone settled one on top of the other over hundreds of millions of years. They formed the Vindhyachal mountains. The largest ones at the northern fringe of the Vindhyas were the Bhimbetka Hills. “For millions of years, the sun and wind and rain scoured the hills in fascinating ways to create these spectacular caves. “Some archaeologists say it may have been Mr. Homo Erectus's family that first wandered into the Bhimbetka caves. About a hundred thousand years ago, they must have used these caves as rock shelters. “They may have dug the little cups or holes we see in these caves even today. Later, our ancestors made the Bhimbetka caves their home.“They lived on animals like deer and wild fowl. They made weapons like bows and arrows, and spears to hunt the animals with and to protect themselves in the jungle. “Theirs must have been a life of adventure and peril, but it was the only one they knew. Often, they were attacked by dangerous animals like wild boar and elephant. Sometimes they fought bravely, sometimes they had to flee for their lives.“Whenever they returned with an animal they had killed, they celebrated their victory with music and dance. “Some of these hunters were artists too. They painted their stories on the walls of their homes to tell us of their adventures from tens of thousands of years ago.”Miss Bandicota Bengalensis stood staring at the pictures. The stories of the old caves seemed to come alive.The two explorers walked into another cave. Its walls were covered with hundreds of images of animals. Miss Bandicota Bengalensis studied them intently under her magnifying glass. Meanwhile, her friend was drawing them in his diary. Pointing at one, he asked, “Can you tell which animal this is?”Miss Bandicota Bengalensis looked at it closely. Then she turned to him, beaming, and exclaimed, “That looks like a mole rat!” After a morning of learning, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis started zipping through the rock shelters. There were hundreds – some narrow, some wide, some tall, some large and some mere crevices, just like burrows!A few hours later, while she was still whizzing around, her friend called out urgently, “Come along, quick. I must show you the most special rock in the Bhimbetka Hills. My father is waiting for me up there.” Miss Bandicota Bengalensis sprinted to catch up and, together, they ran to the edge of the cliff.“Look over the tortoiseshaped rock, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis. You will see the Betwa river basin.” As she drank in the view through her binoculars, Tiku ran off to his father.A cool afternoon breeze blew over the cliff, making her drowsy. She snuggled comfortably into a niche under the tortoise rock. As her eyelids drooped, she heard her friend holler, “Will you be here to explore tomorrow?” A silent wind carried her sleepy reply back to him: “Tonight, I must dig a new burrow. . . to explore a new place tomorrow. . .”Guess what! Team up with Miss Bandicota and guess the names of these animals Tiku has drawn. All are believed to be native to India. Here are some clues to help you along. *Its African cousin is the largest land mammal *One of the grandest birds, best known for its rain dance*The biggest striped member of the cat family *It has a single horn as its scientific name indicatesThe trees of central India Miss Bandicota Bengalensis discovered the old caves of Bhimbetka in the middle of a jungle near the Vindhyachal mountains, in Madhya Pradesh. This state has the highest forest cover in the country. It is famous for its teak, sal and bamboo forests and vast stretches of mixed tropical jungles. Our ancestors lived amid trees and, over the years, discovered their many uses. . Palas is the official state flower of Madhya Pradesh. The tree is also called the flame of the forest because it blooms in orange and scarlet clusters of flowers. The seeds, leaves and gum of this tree are found to be medicinal. . The amla tree bears a light greenishyellow fruit also known as the Indian gooseberry. It is one of the best known natural sources of Vitamin C. . The babul tree is native to India and grows wild in dry and sandy environments. It is a tough and thorny tree that survives drought and flood. The tender twigs of the babul were traditionally used as toothbrushes. . The mahua is an indigenous tree, considered holy by many tribes of the forests of central and north India. Its flower is edible and used for making honey, syrup and jam.	./Story text files/343.txt	11420	18	6.159071367153913	866	297	372	57.56923076923077	88	107	63	11.066666666666666	70	125	658	505	6	1.5942467827403481	1095	226

"Once upon a time, there was a goat called Igodhoobe*. Igodhoobe the goat was the king of farm animals and birds. He lived a good life. One day, Igodhoobe the goat called all the animals and birds to a meeting. *pronounced ​eegodwhobuhe""My friends, I have called you because I had a dream, "" said the goat. All the animals and birds kept quiet. They listened to their king carefully.""I dreamed that there was no food or water left in the land. Many of our relatives died! "" said the king. When the animals and the birds heard the dream, they were worried. ""What shall we do? "" asked the cat.The hen and the duck had an idea. They said, ""Let each one of us bring food and put it in the king's store. "" All the animals agreed with this idea.The king made a rule. He said, ""Get ropes. Tie up anyone who does not bring food to my store. Then carry him to me. ""But, soon after this, it was time for a new king to rule over the farm. All the animals and birds met and elected the cat as their new king.But the goat refused to agree that the cat was king. ""I'm the king. There is no other king. I can't obey any other animal, "" said the goat.The animals took food to the new king's store. But the goat did not take anything. ""When the goat was king, we all obeyed him. Now he does not want to obey our new king. What shall we do? "" asked the cow.All the domestic animals and birds were angry. ""He thinks he is different to us, "" they all muttered.The dog said, ""I helped him when he was king. I did not sleep at night. I was always with him, ready to help. "" The sheep said, ""I gave him my wool to cover his children. ""The sheep said, ""I gave him my wool to cover his children. ""The pig said, ""When he was king, he told his friends that I eat a lot. But I was often in his garden digging and weeding his maize and millet. ""The sheep asked, ""What did he say? That you eat a lot? Did he think that he will be king forever? "" Then the sheep added, ""Let him understand that he is not king any more. I don't know why he thinks he is so important. ""All the animals laughed and agreed that the goat must take food to the new king. King Cat ordered the goat to come to him.When the animals went to fetch the goat, he was sitting on a chair with his legs crossed. ""I shall not go to the cat. There is no other king except me. When you become a king, you are always a king, "" said the goat.""We will tie you with ropes and take you to the new king, "" said the sheep.So the cow tied the goat to her tail. She then pulled him to the king. The sheep, the duck, the dog, the pig, and the cock cheered as the cow pulled the goat. They all shouted, ""Take this stubborn goat to our new king!

"Meet Miss Bandicota Miss Bandicota Bengalensis was a little Indian mole rat who grew up in a maze of burrows with her mother, seven sisters and ten brothers. They were terrific pests, the nineteen of them, always out on a rampage. One night she was out foraging as usual, when suddenly, she heard an angry human voice. Quick and nimble, she just managed to escape from the farmer's scary grasp. As she was fleeing, she looked into the eyes of a mole rat stuck in a trap. Those were the saddest eyes she had ever seen.She was so terrified that she huddled in her mother's burrow all night, her eyes tight shut. In the early hours of twilight she announced to everybody's dismay that she would never attack a farm again. All her brothers and sisters tried to change her mind, but she would not budge. She soon became bored and restless and realised that she couldn't sit in that same old burrow any longer. She quietly packed her explorer's kit with her sunglasses, binoculars, magnifying glass and, of course, her favourite  a strip of sticker bandages.Her mother was worried. ""Whatever will you do? Whatever else can you do? "" Miss Bandicota Bengalensis smiled and said simply, ""I can burrow. "" So she burrowed and burrowed and burrowed and burrowed. But there was never a dull moment, for every burrow she dug went to some place new. And she would never need to attack a farm again.On the Seashore Somebody raised her tiny nose out of a hole in the sand. Who was that? Miss Bandicota Bengalensis! She had just emerged from a new burrow after a long night of digging through sand and clay. The sun was going to rise. Just as she was about to set her sunglasses on top of her nose, she caught a glimpse of the world above.In a flash she was washed back into her burrow. As she struggled to find solid ground, she yelled frantically, ""Help, help! The river has burst it's banks! "" ""There's no need to panic. This is the Arabian Sea, "" said a calm and reassuring voice drifting nearby. A baffled Miss Bandicota Bengalensis scrambled out on to the soggy sand. As she shook her dripping tail, she felt the soft, wet ground sinking slowly beneath her.She was looking down at her toes uneasily, when she noticed something bright and blue floating between her feet! ""You've reached the beach of Bordi, seventeen kilometres of fabulous sticky sand! "" it said.In a fraction of a second, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis had grabbed the magnifying glass from her kit. The very next moment, she was keenly examining the fascinating little creature, as it lingered on, quite unperturbed by this sudden intrusion. It was a strangelooking animal; a round body, silvery grey in the middle, surrounded by a turquoisecoloured ring and numerous translucent tentacles branching out radially.""Who are you? "" asked Miss Bandicota Bengalensis inquisitively. ""You can call us Porpita. We are a colony of polyps, "" it said, swimming by lazily. ""I'm Miss Bandicota Bengalensis. Whatever is. . . er. . . are polyps? "" As you might already know, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis could never resist asking a question. ""Sort of like a family, "" it answered. ""We live together and work in unison. Some of us breathe, eat; some of us taste or feel and some of us make little new polyps. ""Miss Bandicota Bengalensis was most intrigued. ""That doesn't sound like my family at all. We all live in our own burrows, collect our own food and make our own baby mole rats. "" ""How quaint! "" remarked Porpita, ""It must be quite tiring to be a mole rat. "" ""Not at all, we. . . glug glug glug. . . glug. . . glug. . . "" Poor Miss Bandicota Bengalensis swallowed a mouthful of sea water as she was knocked over by a large wave. ""Thoo. . . thoo. . . thoo, "" she spat out, wincing at the horrid taste of salt water. Almost immediately, she leapt towards the shore, dodging another quick wave.As the waves subsided, she turned around to ask Porpita yet another question. And stopped in wonder. Scores of sparkling polyps, just like Porpita, were gliding leisurely over the rolling waves. It was as if the night sky had gently dropped countless twinkling stars into a magical sea. Miss Bandicota Bengalensis stood mesmerised by the polyps that dipped and rose gently with the waves of Bordi. She bid them a silent farewell as they faded into the tranquil waters.""Deeper! Deeper! "" An eager voice shook Miss Bandicota Bengalensis out of her daydream. Her drowsy eyes fell upon a couple of human kids digging the sands of Bordi with funnylooking tools. From her last trip to Kaas Pathar, the plateau of flowers, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis had learned that not every human was a danger to mole rats. So she rushed in to play. ""Can I dig too? "" she pleaded anxiously, ""I love to burrow! ""The kids shrieked and bolted, flinging their beach toys away. Miss Bengalensis looked baffled. She had grown up running away from humans. This was the first time she had seen humans run away from mole rats! ""We're not all out to catch you, you know? "" she hollered after them. But the kids had long disappeared.Miss Bandicota Bengalensis looked at a bright green toy lying next to her feet. She picked it up and made a futile attempt to dig with it. 'No wonder humans can't burrow! ' she thought to herself. She dropped it and began to stroll down the lonely shore.Further down the beach, she came upon a peculiar sight. Tiny balls of sand were scattered around in puzzling patterns. It was as if the seashore was dotted with constellations. 'The mystery of the curious sand balls! ' thought Miss Bandicota Bengalensis. Her face lit up. Holding up her magnifying glass, she was lost in her investigation.Suddenly, she felt a small pinch at the tip of her tail. Swinging around, she spotted a crab looking up at her. ""No need to be nasty! I was just looking, "" Miss Bandicota Bengalensis said reproachfully, tucking her tail between her legs. ""Sorry about that! I was just going about breakfast when your tail came in the way, "" said the crab apologetically. ""Oh, never mind! Mole rats nibble all day too. I know what you mean, "" replied Miss Bandicota Bengalensis, for she happened to be a very forgiving mole rat.""I'm Mrs. Scopimera, "" said the crab. ""I'm Miss Bandicota Bengalensis. Do you know where these tiny balls of sand came from? "" ""Oh, those are just sand bubbles! We make sand balls like that when we suck our food in. """"And do you make them yourself or do you also have a family to help you, like Porpita? "" asked Miss Bandicota Bengalensis. ""Oh! You mean the polyps? I've seen them stick together in rings, bobbing in the water all day. We sand bubblers are nothing like them, "" she said proudly. ""We wander the beach sands, sometimes in pairs, sometimes alone. "" ""We do have large families though, "" she continued. ""My children must be down there, up to some mischief or the other. Would you like to play with them? "" she said in a friendly voice.A little Scopimera peeped out of a hole and called, ""Come on, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis. We're buildinga maze! Will you help us with the burrows? "" ""Burrows? I love burrows! "" Miss Bandicota Bengalensis sprang into the nearest hole, head first. Immediately, she was stuck! She was upside down in the sticky sand, her head in a hole and her legs sticking out in the air. Not one to lose heart easily, she threw her kit into the hole and promptly started burrowing to make a tunnel. The little sand bubbler crabs were thrilled. They had never seen anyone burrow so fast! They all began digging industriously, some sideways, some backwards, some upside down and some all around. In no time the seashore of Bordi was dug up into a secret maze. Miss Bandicota Bengalensis wanted to try out every new tunnel in it!Can you help Miss Bandicota Bengalensis get back to her travel kit through the secret maze? Miss Bandicota Bengalensis scurried excitedly through the underground maze at lightning speed. She finally reached her travel kit with shining eyes and a triumphant smile. She had never crossed so many new burrows in such little time!As she climbed out of the hole, she gasped in horror, ""The sea has vanished! "" She scampered around in circles, only to turn back again and again, ""Gone! Disappeared! "" As her eyes grew bigger and rounder in shock, more and more Scopimera kids clutched at their tummies and rolled in laughter. Poor Miss Bandicota Bengalensis!""There! There! It's just low tide, "" said Mrs. Scopimera kindly, coming to her rescue. ""It's just low what? "" asked a puzzled Miss Bandicota Bengalensis. ""Low tide. The sea water recedes during low tide and returns when the tide is high. Nothing to worry about, you know, it happens twice a day. That's when we sand bubblers get to eat. We have to rush into our holes again when the waves return. "" ""But where does the sea go? "" ""Just far, far behind. The water only seems to disappear over the flat and gentle Bordi sands. If you look hard enough, you will see a foamy white line. That's where the shore is now. ""Miss Bandicota Bengalensis fished out her binoculars hastily. Sure enough, she could see the waves of the Arabian Sea in the distant horizon. She heaved sigh of relief and collapsed on the sand. All that running around had made her very hungry and very thirsty. So she she began yet another journey, this time in search of food and water.Mrs. Scopimera accompanied her down the beach, up to the rows of casuarina trees. There, she wished Miss Bandicota Bengalensis luck and returned to her children. Miss Bandicota Bengalensis trotted ahead, along the edge of the beach. Her legs began to hurt. The tip of her tail, where Mrs. Scopimera had pinched it, was smarting.Always prepared, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis stuck her sticker bandage around her tail. The strong little mole rat walked steadily on, even as the rays of the sun beat down upon her. After what seemed like a zillion steps, she reached a sharp bend in the road.As the coast turned inwards, to her joy, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis discovered a charming grove of chickoo trees. The branches, laden with soft brown fruit, swung low. The orchard grounds were strewn sweet ripe chickoos.A farm pond lay nestled in the shadows of a hundred trees. Miss Bandicota Bengalensis first rushed to the edge of the pond and drank to her heart's content. Now refreshed, she dashed around the trees, madly gathering a heap of chickoos. She made a heap any self respecting mole rat would be proud of!Pleased with the morning's work, Miss Bandicota Bengalensis leaned back to admire the most alluring pile of fruit she had ever seen. Her greedy fingers couldn't wait to poke into the soft ripe skin. Her greedy toes couldn't wait to jump on the pile. Nobody saw the very hungry mole rat pounce on the chickoos.But before long. . . A busy honey bee was foraging around in the afternoon, when she came upon an enormous pile of black and beady chickoo seeds. A happy mole rat lay curled in a hole beneath it. ""A good worker works all day and sleeps only at night, "" muttered the honey bee. A very sleepy Miss Bandicota Bengalensis turned over and murmured, ""Sleep at night? No, no, no, not at all. Tonight, I must dig a new burrow. . . ""Bandicota bengalensis, also known as the Indian mole rat, is a giant rat of South Asia. It is not related to the true bandicoot. They can be up to  cm long, including the tail. They are seen as pests because they damage cereal crops and gardens. They make piglike grunts when attacking. The name 'bandicoot' is derived from the Telugu word pandikokku, which translates to 'pigrat'.Did you know that Porpita porpita is also called the 'blue button jellyfish'? But it is actually not a jellyfish at all! As you now know, it is a colony of many tentacleshaped animals. They all float together and eat through a single mouth in the centre of the button!Can you believe that the chickoo (scientific name: Manilkara zapota) is not from India? It came from faraway Central American countries like Mexico. The chickoo travelled across the oceans with adventurers just like Miss Bandicota to reach the shores of India, maybe about  years ago.The sand bubbler crab does not have lungs. So how does it breathe? It has 'gas windows' on its legs, through which it takes in oxygen. At high tide, the land crab depends on the air trapped in its burrows. At low tide, it emerges, to feed and make sand bubbles."	./Story text files/168.txt	12330	23	5.837262357414449	1021	294	171	51.92274678111588	114	119	28	10.399141630901287	100	133	760	555	7	1.5143237841439041	1258	243
Shanti and Arun were good friends. They had so much fun together. They shared secrets in class. They ran races on the way home. She was always cheerful.One day, Shanti came into the classroom slowly. Her head was bent. She looked sad. “Did someone scold you?” asked Arun. Shanti shook her head. She sat down and did not look up. She did not answer ‘Present! ’ when Sona Miss called her name. Sona Miss called again, louder this time, “Shanti Kumar!” Shanti raised her hand.“Do you have a sore throat?” her teacher asked her. Shanti shook her head. Her cheeks were red and it looked like she had a fever. “Are you feeling okay?” Sona Miss asked. Shanti nodded, still not daring to look up.“Why does Shanti look so sad?” “Is your little brother okay?” “Is your puppy okay?” “Is your grandmother okay?” Shanti kept nodding her head to each of her friends. But she did not look up.Arun wanted to make her smile. He had an idea! He took out something from his bag. As he ran to show it to Shanti, it slipped out of his hands. Shanti saw something flying towards her and she grabbed it.It was a BIG, green, rubber frog! Shanti's eyes flew open. Then she opened her mouth to laugh. THEN Arun and her friends saw why she had not smiled or talked all day! Four of her front teeth had gone missing!	./Story text files/258.txt	1288	12	5.432624113475177	128	13	71	31.225	34	6	16	6.95	31	9	98	43	3	1.2716763005780347	168	5
Tomorrow is my birthday, A day of special fun I want the stars to wish me The moon too, and the sun.I wake up in the morning And look at what I see! A rocket waiting outside; I try and hide my glee. The rocket is all fired up, My bags are packed and full. 'Whoosh! ' it roars and shoots up, I’m Astronaut Madam Gul! My cat, she shakes and trembles, My head spins round and round. In just a few minutes, We are way above the ground.Six hours later, here it is My new home in outer space They call it Space Station; Hello, you beautiful place!Boing! we go from step to step, I hardly feel my legs. Before we even know it, We turn down on our heads! And then begins the floating, To the left and to the right. Drifting through the air we go, And twisting to the side.Oops! My bag turns upside down And out come two jalebis. Samosas that I packed so well, I think they’ve all gone crazy! They bump around and float across, The crumbs and icky juice. I'll stick to labelled packets, Of these special space foods.My hair is all so sticky, The clothes are such a mess. My cat, she tries to lick me clean; A bath will work the best. But here’s a little secret, There are no taps in space. I wet this towel just a bit And wipe it on my face. Then squeeze some shampoo in my hair And rub it through and through. A final proper wiping, My hair looks clean and new.I get into my space suit For a very special day. Come and join me in the fun, It’s space walk all the way! Step by step I go outside, A slow and dangerous crawl. It’s dark and cold and quiet, I’m connected to the walls. The stars are shining clear and bright They look so big and near. The moon just smiles and seems to say 'Happy Birthday, Gul dear. 'It’s time for me to head back in And get some cosy rest. The space walk was so tiring; That was scary, but the best.This is where I need to sleep, My bed for next few days. What fun it is to squeeze right in And strap myself in place. I wake up after some time, No minute we can waste But first I go and brush my teeth And swallow all the paste!I want to speak to Ammi, My laptop's strapped in place. 'Hello, who’s that? ' she screams from there, 'I’m Gul from outer space! ' I tell her of the things I’ve done, Of magic that is space. Of how the earth looks far from here, Of this Station’s funny ways.I live in space for two full months, It’s time to head back soon. Far away we hear some child Wish for journeys to the moon. Raise your hand if that is you And keep your bags all checked. My cat and I return tonight, It’ll soon be your turn next.Did You Know?  You need to sit inside a rocket to go into space. There are different kinds of rockets, but the most common one is the kind that Gul and her cat go in. The rocket takes them to the International Space Station (ISS), which is Gul’s home in space for two months. They use a spacecraft called Soyuz to return to Earth from the ISS.  There are spacecrafts that go from Earth to ISS carrying specially packed food and water, and other things that astronauts need to live there. Gul has to be careful with the use of water inside the space station. Every drop is precious. Gul and the other objects inside the ISS float like balloons. Anything that is not strapped down will float because they appear to become weightless in space. This happens because the space station itself and everything inside it are falling very fast towards Earth all the time. It is this falling with speed that makes Gul feel weightless. But if they are falling, why doesn’t everything not crash on to Earth? That’s because our planet is round, and as the ISS and everything inside it falls down, down, down, the Earth’s surface curves away from them and they never reach the ground.  There are no taps inside the ISS because water cannot flow down in a weightless environment. So Gul has to use a special shampoo that does not need to be rinsed off, and she also swallows her toothpaste. If Gul leaves a water bag open by mistake, drops of water will start floating all over the space station and combine to form a big ball of water.	./Story text files/369.txt	4074	13	5.355769230769231	359	57	174	63.682539682539684	11	52	32	13.571428571428571	7	56	266	150	5	1.2595744680851064	445	25

"This is Jadav, a treeplanter. He loves treeplaces because they are full of life. Notreeplaces make him terribly sad, because they are full of dead things.Years ago, Jadav was walking along the banks of the great Brahmaputra River when he arrived at a big, empty no treeplace. It was dry and hot. The sand was powdery and striped.Striped sand? How odd. Jadav went closer to take a better look. Oh, but they weren't stripes at all! The ground was covered in snakes! Last night’s floods must have washed them ashore, Jadav thought.These snakes weren't slinking and slithering and swaying about like regular, healthy snakes. When Jadav walked among them, they didn't hiss or run away or try to bite him. They just lay about like old ropes, tired and still. ""Poor snakes! They're dying from the heat! If only they had some shade to lie in! If only this notreeplace had some trees in it! ""Jadav couldn't bear to watch the snakes die. It made him so terribly sad that he sat down and began to cry. But he quickly came to his senses. ""No more crying. From now on: only trying! "" He jumped up, ran back to his village and began collecting all the bamboo shoots he could carry in his bag. ""Regular plants won't grow in the hot sand, but bamboo will. Bamboo is strong! ""Jadav brought the shoots to the notreeplace and started planting them everywhere. It was hard, hot work, and it took years. The river grew thin one summer and flooded the next, sometimes bringing more sand and sometimes taking it away. Heavy rains came and went. But Jadav kept on planting.In time, the bamboo took root and began to grow. As it grew, it brought shade, and the shade brought insects. The insects burrowed into the ground, and the earth below the bamboo trees began to change. The dry and white became rich and brown, and the dead sand became living soil.Jadav was no longer sad. But he wasn't happy either. He looked around his bamboo grove and thought, ""A fewtreesplace is nice, I know. But how wonderful it would be if this were a manytreesplace! "" The idea thrilled him. So Jadav went back to his village and began collecting many more seeds and saplings. He filled three big bags with Arjun and ejar and gulmohar and koroi and moj and himolu. ""Now that our fewtreesplace has lovely brown soil, we can plant all these and more! ""Jadav brought his new saplings and seeds to the fewtreesplace and planted them all around. It was hard work, his back hurt, and it took many years. The orange and blue skies turned purple and pink, and villages became towns. The wind grew laden with dust, and the river became grey. But Jadav's insect friends helped to till the soil, and his tall bamboos gave him shade and cooled the air. And Jadav kept on planting.Soon, his Arjun, ejar and gulmohar, his koroi, moj and himolu, and all his many other plants dug in, took root and started growing. As they grew, they spread new seeds, and the new seeds, in turn, took root. Shoots became trunks, trunks grew branches, and the branches reached for the sky.The fewtreesplace that was once a notreeplace now became a wonderful, green manytreesplace. But what's a manytreesplace without many treecreatures? When one came, the others followed.First, came the birds. They flocked and flew in from near and far, to make their nests in Jadav's treeplace. There were vultures and pelicans and storks and ducks. And warblers and thrushes and wagtails and chats.Next, came the animals. They skipped and swung and sauntered in, to make their homes in the manytreesplace. There were buffaloes and deer and rabbits and gibbons. And elephants and tigers and rhinos.Finally, there came the snakes. They slithered and swayed and sashayed in, to cool themselves in the shade of Jadav's trees. When Jadav saw the snakes, he sat down and cried happy tears. He was so happy that he wasn't even afraid of getting bitten.Jadav's treeplace had filled with feathers and beaks and wings, with claws and tails and fangs. There were spots and splashes, stripes and flashes, and green, green, everywhere. The treeplace was a forest, at last. And Jadav was a happy man.Then Jadav had another thought. ""Many trees in one place is good, I know. But how wonderful it'd be if there were many trees in every place! "" So he grabbed his bags of seeds and started walking across the world. And as he walked, Jadav started planting the seeds in all the notreeplaces he saw. And he planted. And planted. And planted. But there are so many notreeplaces in the world. There are more notreeplaces than treeplaces now. This is terribly sad, but Jadav does not sit down and cry this time.Jadav plants.And plants. And plants some more.It’s going to be hard work, bringing all the old forests back. The seas have begun rising, and the winds grow cold. Towns have become cities, and Jadav is growing old. But he keeps on planting. And planting. And planting.Jadav will keep on planting until the whole world is a happy, lovely lotsoftreesplace.Jadav in Real Life Jadav ‘Mulai’ Payeng is a conservationist and recipient of the Padmashree, one of the highest civilian honours awarded by the Indian government. Jadav lives in Majuli, Assam. At the age of , distressed by the sight of dying snakes that had washed up on a sandbar banking the Brahmaputra, Jadav decided to plant some trees in the spot. He started small, with bamboos, and grew an entire forest, plant by painstaking plant. This was back in . Over the next three decades, Jadav and his tree planting have managed to change the soil in the barren area. The hectare sandbar is now a lush, dense forest and home to a variety of flora and fauna, including elephants, tigers, apes, deer and many species of local and migratory birds. Jadav continues to visit and nurture his forest every day, planting wherever he finds empty patches.Growing Up With a Mango Tree: a TreePlanting Activity Just ate a mango? Loved it? Want another? You can go to a shop and buy one, of course. But it's a lot more fun (and free! ) to use the seed of the mango you just ate and make a few fruits of your own. All you need is time and patience. First, find a nice patch of empty land near your house. Get a friend, sibling or grownup to help you plant the seed you saved in that patch. Make sure the soil is loose and there's plenty of sun. It may take several weeks of waiting, watering and watching before your seed turns into a plant, so don't worry and definitely don't hurry.Once your seed germinates and grows into a healthy mango plant, get ready for a lot more waiting, watering and watching. Take care that your plant doesn't get eaten up by insects or animals, or get stepped on by someone. If all this waiting is making you feel bored, read a few books, sing some songs, and plant some more plants! After a few years, as you grow taller, your mango plant will grow tall with you, until it becomes a big tree that you can climb and picnic under. This is when the real fun begins. By now, your tree will have started making its own mangoes, which you and your friends can eat. Even better, those mangoes will soon start attracting other mango loving creatures to your tree: birds, ants, squirrels, bats, monkeys, spiders and lots more. Some of these creatures will come to eat the fruit, some will come to feed on the tree's sap, some to drink nectar from its flowers, and some creatures will even come to eat some of the other creatures hanging around the tree. But it's not all about eating. Some creatures may come just to rest in your tree's shade, or to take a nap in its branches. Your tree has many different uses for every different creature! Spend some time every day watching who visits your mango tree, at which time of the day they come, and what they do. Write down what you see in your notebook. Also draw pictures of what you see. See how much you've done and learned with just one mango seed? Isn't treeplanting fun? Now imagine how much fun Jadav must have had planting his entire forest full of trees!"	./Story text files/251.txt	7974	22	5.899491094147582	640	146	226	60.34615384615385	59	71	44	11.953846153846154	48	82	479	307	5	1.4513966480446927	792	103
"Tara and Ravi are going to the market. Amma has given them a list of fruits and vegetables to buy. At the market, Tara spots juicy red tomatoes. ""I hope Amma makes tomato chutney today, "" she says.Monappa, the vegetable seller, weighs everything. Into the bag goes:   kg fresh red tomatoes  ½ kg onions  ½ kg potatoes   coconut   limes *Half is written as ½. It means one out of two equal parts of something. *A kilogram is written as kg.Tara and Ravi walk home singing: ""We want . . . Tomato chutney, tomato chutney. Amma's tasty tomato chutney! ""Suddenly Ravi asks Tara, ""Is something dripping on your feet too? "" Their bag is wet. Oh no! The tomatoes are all squashed at the bottom. Tara whispers to Ravi, ""Our tomato chutney looks so horrible. Not at all like Amma's! ""The next week, Tara and Ravi are careful. ""Heavy vegetables at the bottom; soft and light ones on top, "" Ravi keeps repeating. Into the bag goes:   watermelon  ½ kg potatoes   coconut  ½ kg grapes   raw bananas  ½ kg tomatoes, right on top.But at home, they find the grapes have become grape juice under the raw bananas! ""Last time we made the tomatoes into chutney. This time we made the grapes into juice. Wonder what we will do next! "" Tara says sadly.Next time, Amma's list also has oranges. They are soft and light. So they go on top, next to the tomatoes.Just as Tara and Ravi are walking home singing their chutney song, their friends see them. They are thirsty, so they eat up all the oranges!At home, Amma hugs them when she hears about the missing oranges. She tells them not to feel sad.Next week, Tara and Ravi are clever. They hide the oranges under the lightest thing  a bunch of pudina leaves. Now their thirsty friends will not spot the oranges!That night, Amma makes her tasty tomato chutney and lemon rice. Tara and Ravi gobble up their dinner. And what do they get later? Sweet, juicy oranges, of course!.

This book is all about seals.The scientific name for a seal is a PINNIPED. Seals are a widespreadand diversegroupof fin footed,semiaquatic,marine mammals. Seals belong to the orderCarnivora. Theirclosest living relatives arebears, otters, weasels,and raccoons.There are three types of seal families: ●Odobenidae:whose only living (extant) member is thewalrus;●Otariidae:the eared seals( sea lionsand fur seals); and● Phocidae: the earless, or true seals.The smallest seal is the Baikal seal at around  metre (ft in) long and  kilograms (lbs). The biggest is the southern elephant seal, at over  m (ft) and  ton (, lb), making it also the largest carnivoran.Seals spend most of their lives in the water, but come ashore to mate, give birth, or escape from predators, like sharks and killer whales.Seals have streamlined bodies and four limbs in the form of flippers, that act as paddles in the water. They are not as fast in the water as dolphins, but much more flexible and agile.Fur seals and sea lions use their front limbs primarily to propel themselves through the water. Earless seals and walruses use their hind limbs to move through water.Fur seals, sea lions, and walruses have hind limbs that can be pulled under the body and used as legs on land. Travel for earless or true seals is more cumbersome on land, as they waddle along on their sea adapted flippers.Sea lions and fur seals (otariids) have visible external ears, while earless or true seals (phocids) and walruses lack these.Seals have welldeveloped senses—their eyesight and hearing are adapted for both air and water, and they have an advanced tactile system in their vibrissae (whiskers).Some types of seal are well adapted for diving to great depths, they have a layer of fat (blubber) under the skin to keep them warm. All species, except walruses, are covered in fur.Although seal species can be found all around the world, most prefer colder waters, in the higher latitudes or polar currents .Seals feed largely on fish and other small marine animals. A few, like the leopard seal, feed on larger animals such as penguins and other seals. Walruses are specialized for feeding on bottomdwelling sea life.Seal pups are typically born in the spring and summer months, females bear almost all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species stay on land, fasting, so as to nurse their young for short periods, while others take foraging trips to sea between nursing bouts. Walruses are known to nurse their young while at sea.Seals produce a number of sounds or vocalizations, like the loud barks of California sea lions, the gonglike calls of walruses, and the beautiful and complex songs of Weddell seals.The meat, blubber and fur coats of seals have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Seals are now protected from hunting by international law. Besides hunting, seals also face threats from accidental trapping, marine pollution, and conflicts with local people.The Japanese sea lion and the Caribbean monk seal have become extinct in the past century, while the Mediterranean monk seal and Hawaiian monk seal are ranked 'Critically Endangered' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.Seals have been endeared in various cultures worldwide. They are commonly kept in captivity and are may be trained to perform tricks and tasks.We hope you enjoyed all the seals! zSeal Classifications (Wikipedia)	./Story text files/445.txt	3423	25	6.716012084592145	228	103	236	96.82857142857142	6	29	37	16.742857142857144	6	29	123	208	8	1.7833333333333334	289	71
Today, we will climb up a ladder together. It is a rather unusual ladder. In this ladder, the distance between the rungs gets bigger and BIGGER and BIGGER as you climb up the steps, growing  times at each step. Sometimes we will climb one step at a time and at other times we will skip many steps at one go. The funny thing is that we are not even sure which the last step is or whether the steps go on forever. Let the exciting journey begin!Step :  metre What do a five year old boy, a cricket bat and a newborn baby elephant have in common? All of them have a height of about  metre (or m for short)! It would be awkward to say that the ceiling of a room is  baby elephants high. So we make the sensible choice of saying that the height of the ceiling is  metres.Step :  metres Now that you have a feel for the size of one metre, we are ready to climb to the next step of our ladder, at  metres. A three storey building or a mango tree is roughly  metres high. A cricket pitch is about twice that length. Can you think of other objects that are about  m long or high?Step :  metres Have you noticed that with every step we add a zero to the right of the number we had before and the step number matches the number of zeroes? Keep track of that as we climb along. If you have run the m race on school sports day, or watched sprinters do it on TV, you know exactly how far that is. Now imagine if the m track stood up! That would be about the height of two Gol Gumbaz*es. *The Gol Gumbaz in Bijapur, Karnataka, is the tomb of Mohammed Adil Shah. When it was built in , it had the largestStep :  metres Thousand metres has a special name  it is called  kilometre or  km. You would cover this distance if you ran the  metre race  times  phew! You would need to climb about  km to reach the top of Mount Everest.Step : , ,  metres Now let's skip  steps and go to step , which has six zeroes to the right of . The distance from the northern tip of India in Kashmir to the southern tip at Kanyakumari is about  times this distance, or  times , ,  m, or , ,  m.

Ask the children to cut long strips (each about an inch wide) from old newspapers. . Ask them to stick the strips end to end with tape or glue to make longer strips, until they get a strip that is  metre long (they can use a measuring tape for this). . Now ask the children to use this  m long strip as a measure and make  similar strips and stick them end to end to make a  m long strip. They can lie down next to this strip, head to head and feet to feet, and see how many of them it takes to make  m. . They can then stick ten  m strips together to make a  m strip that goes round the classroom many times.Notes for Parents & Teachers:  When writing down big numbers with lots of zeroes after the , it is very easy for children  and adults!  to make mistakes. That is why the 'Powers of ' notation is such a useful thing. Through this book, children can be taught how to use it  all they need to do is to count the number of zeroes to the right of the , and write that number as a superscript of . For instance, , which has  zeroes after the , can be written as . And  ( zeroes after the ), can be compactly written as . Simple!  In this book, we stopped our 'How far is far? ' game at the Sun. If you want to take the game further, you may want to bring in the nearest star beyond the Sun, Proxima Centauri, which is  m away from the Sun. Or the distance from one end of the Milky Way to another, which is , , , , , , , , , ,  (or ) m!  One thing you should know is that the distances that are given in the book are approximate, not exactly accurate. For example,  km is given as  km. This is not 'unscientific'. Rough estimates are very useful in science! Maybe you can do an activity with the kids to emphasize this.

Dear… well, you know who you are. And it’s not like you’re ever going to see this letter. Miss told me that I had to be your mentor and show you around because you are a new student. I didn’t know what a ‘mentor’ is, so I looked it up in the dictionary. Anyway, she didn’t tell me anything about that. Ali and Gaurav and Sumi and Rani, they kept asking me about it when we were going home from school. I told them that I didn’t know what they were talking about, but that’s not true. How can I not know? See, you made me lie to my friends. Yours sincerely, MeHi again, Ma says that it is not good to stare at people, but I can see that everyone stares at you. They stare at me too because I have to hang around with you and be your ‘mentor’. Why did you come to our school? Why couldn’t you continue going to whatever school you went to earlier? Do you know what happened yesterday? Gaurav, Ali and two of their friends from Class VII cornered me after school to ask about youknowwhat. They took my bag and wouldn’t give it back. Then they threw it into the thicket by the side of the road and I had to scramble down into the mountainside to get it. I tore my shirt and Ma was angry with me. This is all your fault. MeHello, I keep telling them that they can ask you whatever they want to know. What’s the point of asking me? How am I supposed to know why you have that thing or how it works? To be really honest, I can’t say I’m not curious myself or that I don’t have the same questions the others are asking me. Yes, I noticed it the first day when you came into the classroom. I saw how you did everything with one hand and how your left hand never moved. At first I couldn’t tell what the problem was. Then, when I came closer, I saw that something wasn’t quite right. It looked weird, like it was covered in plastic or something. Then I thought it was a toy hand. It took me some time to understand. Also, I saw what happened at lunch. See you, MeHello, My oldest sister, the one who’s studying engineering in Delhi, called today. I told her, “There’s a girl in my class and she has a fake hand,” and she said that the term is “prosthetic hand” . Listen, I have some advice for you. You may be new and all, but if you want people to stop staring at you and talking about you, you have to stop standing in the corner all the time. Why don’t you play with us? Why don’t you come on the swing? Everyone loves the swing. It’s been two weeks, and you can jolly well come by yourself. I am not going to be your minder for ever. Sometimes I don’t know what to say to you. MeHi again, After the lunch incident that day, I’ve been watching you. I’m just curious. Is it weird to have one hand? Is it only your hand or is your entire arm fake, sorry, prosthetic? Today, Sumi, Gaurav and I walked to school together. They were playing a game they made up called OneHand Challenge. The rule is, you have to do things with one hand. Like, packing your bag or buttoning your shirt.Sumi couldn’t tie her shoelaces and she forgot about it and tripped and fell. She got a cut on her chin. Miss saw it and, even though she put some antiseptic cream on it, she scolded Sumi for being careless. “You can’t run around in the mountains with your shoelaces untied. What will happen if you fall while going home or something?” I think adults worry too much. Yours truly, MeHi, Do you know what a coincidence is? It’s like when you talk about something and the same thing happens sometime later in a completely unrelated way. In my last letter, I was telling you about Sumi and the shoelaces, and then, today, I saw you tying your shoelaces. Wow, that was awesome! I think you did it faster than I can do it with two hands. If you were my friend, I would challenge you to a shoelacetying race. Or no, maybe I would ask you to teach me how to do it with one hand. I have to confess, I did try to tie my shoelace with one hand when I got home. But it’s impossible. How do you do it? Maybe I’ll ask you tomorrow. Curious, MeHi, So, after what you said, I’ve tried to do a lot of things with only one hand, but it’s so difficult! I still don’t get how you do it, like having a bath, wearing your clothes, packing your bag. Since that day at lunch, I did realize that you have to do some things differently, but it’s not like you don’t do almost everything the rest of us do. Listen, I’m sorry about what I said earlier. . . about playing with us. I guess you were just feeling shy. And also about coming on the swing. I tried and it’s hard to get your balance if you don’t hold it with two hands. But you’re great in the jungle gym, even if you don’t hang from the bars, and you can run really fast, even faster than Ali, who won the first prize at Sports Day. Bye, MeHello! That movie was really funny, no? I laughed so much that my stomach hurt and it was like I was crying. I always like it when they show movies in school. It means no classes. Last time, before you came to our school, they showed this movie about a tiger cub who got lost. It was quite scary, mostly because it was a true story. Later someone found it and managed to get it back to its family. True stories like that are called documentaries, did you know that? Tiger cubs are cute, no? Last year, there was a puppy near our house. It was very cute too, but it grew up and then it wasn’t so cute any more. Got to go now! MeHello, hello! Did you know? I was so surprised when I saw you on the bus. I had no idea my father worked in the same place as yours! But I’m so happy you came for the office picnic, because last year when they took us, there were no other children my age and I got really bored. Okay, I’m really tired, so I’m going now. See you in school tomorrow. MeHi, I think I should warn you, Principal Sir becomes slightly insane whenever Annual Day comes along. He might yell at you — he yells at everyone — so don’t take it personally. My ma says that he’s under a lot of pressure because our Annual Day performance reflects on him. I’m not sure what that means, but he does look stressed out. Did you see his hair? It was like he touched a loose wire and got an electric shock! Though I think it was very mean of Rani to put a frog in his chair. Okay, I’m going now before he catches me writing this letter! MeHey, Your new hand is so cool! No offence, but the old one was a bit boring. It was just… there. The new one is like magic, and you can move the fingers and grip with it! I hope you didn’t mind that I asked to shake hands. I just said it before I could think. Maybe tomorrow we can do some experiments to find out if you can lift stuff with it. Oh! I just realized, the last couple of letters I wrote to you, I didn’t mention your prosthetic hand at all. It’s like I forgot all about it and wanted to tell you so many other things. The funny thing is, I’m not that curious about your hand any more. I don’t know why. Your friend, MeTHE FRIENDOMETER QUIZ How good are you at helping people fit in?

Basava and his sister Sundari sat on the sand watching the sun rise over the sea. Slowly, the sky turned from grey to blue and the edges of the clouds became an orange colour. They sat staring at the horizon – that line in the distance where the bowl of the sky seemed to curve down to meet the sea. Their father was a sailor who had sailed away on a merchant ship many months ago. The children were eagerly waiting for him to come back home. So, every morning at sunrise, they came and waited by the beach hoping to see the tall red sails of their father’s ship rise slowly above the horizon. The children had seen many ships come and go because they lived in Mamallapuram, which was a busy port. The ships came from many distant lands carrying exciting cargo – chests of silk and pottery, jars full of wine, perfumes and even horses. Their father’s ship had sailed out carrying logs of cedar and sandalwood, and bags of spices, rice and ghee. “It’s been so many months,” Sundari said sadly, “Appa has never been away for so long.” “Remember that big storm last week?” Basava added worriedly, “The sea was full of high waves. I hope Appa’s ship is safe.”“Look, a ship is coming!” said Sundari excitedly, “But I can’t see the sails.” As they watched eagerly, a ship appeared on the horizon. It was a small dot that slowly grew larger as it came closer. First, they saw the sails filling out with the wind. Then the high masts and the wooden bow rose into view. “No,” said Basava, disappointed, “Appa’s ship has red sails with a flying eagle painted on them. This one has black and green sails.” They felt disappointed and decided to go home. They had work to do — they had to help their mother at her vegetable stall in the market. Their father was often away from home and after a while all the money he left behind would get over. That is why their mother sold vegetables, so that they had enough to eat. Sundari enjoyed working at the vegetable stall. The market was such an interesting place! Often their customers were sailors from different lands – some with pale skins and narrow tilted eyes and some with dark skins and curly hair. They wore odd clothes and jewellery and spoke in languages Sundari could not understand at all!This morning, as Basava was laying out bundles of spinach and cabbage, one of their regular customers came to buy vegetables. She was the wife of a trader who often sent spices to other lands by ship. She knew all about the ships coming and going from Mamallapuram. As she picked through the radishes and beans, the trader’s wife asked, “Any news of your father?” Sundari shook her head sadly. “Why don’t you go and ask at the jetty where all the ships are anchored?” she said. “Ask what?” Basava leaned forward eagerly. “Ask the sailors if they have seen your father’s ship on their way to Mamallapuram. My husband does that quite often when his ships are late.” That afternoon, the children headed towards the main jetty. They went through the market and took the street going towards the sea. They went past the warehouses where the merchants kept the goods meant to be loaded into ships. In one warehouse, labourers were unloading bags of pepper and coriander seeds. In another, they were stacking up bales of cotton cloth woven in brightThree ships stood anchored at the jetty, tied to the shore by thick ropes. Two more ships were waiting out at sea. Small boats were moving in and out among them with the boatmen selling everything from flowers and fruits to beads and woodcarvings. Among the ships anchored at the jetty was the ship with the black and green sails that they had seen in the morning. They went towards a ship that was being loaded with goods. As they neared it, a soldier carrying a spear stopped them. “Halt! Watch where you are going!” the man yelled. “No one is allowed on this ship without a royal permit.” “Permit?” Sundari looked puzzled. “Why?” “Because it is a royal ship, you silly girl!” “You mean this ship belongs to the royal navy?” Basava’s eyes widened in surprise. “Are we going to war?” “Of course not! This is a trading ship. His Majesty King Narasimha Varman owns many ships that trade with far off kingdoms. This one is going to the port of Tamralipti in the north.” “We are looking for a ship that has come from the kingdom of Kamboja…” Sundari began hesitantly.“Our father is a sailor and he sailed for Kamboja many months ago. We want to ask the sailors if they have seen his ship.” “Kamboja?” the soldier asked. He then pointed to the ship with the black and green sails and said, “That ship’s arrived from there.” Basava and Sundari ran to the ship, up the gangplank and on to its deck. They stopped when they saw that all the sailors on board were foreigners. They were speaking to each other in a strange tongue! “Oh no!” Basava sighed. “How do we make them understand us?” “Easy!” Sundari grinned. “We talk to them like Amma does when they come to buy vegetables.” “Of course!” laughed Basava, “We act and make signs with our hands.” They looked around trying to spot a sailor with a friendly face. Finally, they went up to a sailor sitting on a roll of rope.He was an old man with a dark, leathery, sunburnt face. There were deep lines around his narrow eyes. He wore loose pyjamas, a sleeveless jacket, bright bangles and earrings. “Kamboja?” Sundari asked nervously. The man nodded happily, “Kamboja!” Basava pointed to the sail, then he pointed to the red skirt Sundari was wearing and said, “Ship? Red sail?” The man frowned and shook his head. Sundari tried to explain. She tapped the side of the ship and said, “Ship?” Then she pointed to the sails and to her skirt, “Sail? Red?” The man pointed to the sea and said something in his own language. “Yes! A ship with red sails. Have you seen it?” Sundari asked excitedly. The man looked a bit puzzled. “Our father… Appa!” Sundari was acting out a tall man with a moustache. “Oh!” The man then flapped his arms to mimic a bird flying.“YES!” the children jumped and yelled in delight, “A flying eagle is on the sail!” The man was laughing as he stood up and pulled them by their hands to the other end of the ship. Then he pointed to the horizon where a ship was slowly sailing towards them, its red sails blowing proudly in the breeze. Basava and Sundari were speechless! There, before their eyes, were the familiar high masts, the curving prow, the red sails with flying eagles. . . “Your Appa is a sailor?” the man asked gently, looking at their delighted faces. “Is he on that ship?” “Oh!” The children stared at him in disbelief. “You can speak our language!” Sundari exclaimed. “A little bit,” the man laughed. “I come to Mamallapuram often. But I did enjoy your acting, especially ‘the tall man with the moustache’ part!” Basava and Sundari taught their sailorfriend many new words as they stood at the jetty, waiting happily for the ship to come home.. Basava and Sundari lived over  years ago in the kingdom of King Narasimha Varman of the famous Pallava dynasty. The Pallava kingdom extended over presentday Tamil Nadu. . The town of Mamallapuram is near Chennai and is famous for its temples. At one time, it was a port from where ships sailed to Cambodia, Burma and Indonesia. Kamboja is the ancient name of Cambodia and Tamralipti was a port in Bengal.. What did children study in school in the Pallava times? The subjects included logic, law, mathematics, grammar, astronomy, philosophy, the Vedas, economics and politics. . Women, especially of noble families, were educated, but were not allowed to study the Vedas. . People in the Pallava times dyed their hair, used scented hair oil and perfumes. They even used toothpicks after their meals!	./Story text files/340.txt	7698	15	5.816223067173637	645	144	150	53.21830985915493	67	75	29	10.711267605633802	61	81	470	319	5	1.5097826086956523	782	138
When you want to make a call, what do you do? Reach out for a cell phone? Or use a landline plugged to a wall? Perhaps the one in the post office or the phone at the grocery store, where you pay the shopkeeper to use it? Whichever it is, the way you make the call remains the same: you enter the number and wait for it to ring. But it wasn’t always this simple.Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in the s. He made the first call on March , , in his office in Boston, USA, to his assistant Thomas Watson. Bell shouted into the mouthpiece, asking Watson to come and see him. The assistant heard Bell through his earpiece and came running from the next room. At that time, the telephones did not have dials  the two phones were directly connected to each other by a wire!As more people began to get telephones, a central place called an exchange was set up. The exchange had a switchboard connected to every telephone in the area. An operator could plug in the wires on a switchboard to connect any two phones. A switchboard looked like this.And the telephones looked like this. They had a separate mouthpiece to speak into and an earpiece to listen from. They still didn’t have number dials! How did you make calls then?“Hello! How may I help you?” “Operator, could you please connect me to Doctor Andrew?” “One moment.” First, you picked up the receiver. A telephone operator would greet you. The operator would then plug in a few wires and the doctor’s phone would start ringing.But you had to be mindful of what you said, because the telephone operator could listen to your conversation if she wanted to.As the number of telephones grew, it was not possible for an operator to know all the connections. So telephones were designed to have dials. You dialled a number instead of telling the operator to connect you. This number would get transmitted to a switchboard that could automatically connect telephones. However, operators still routed longdistance calls.In the late s, the design of the phone changed. What changed? The mouthpiece and the earpiece were fused into a single handset. You could hold the handset in one hand, or cradle it between your neck and shoulder, leaving your hands free to write or wear your watch.Soon, people wanted to make calls on the move. No, they didn’t have cell phones yet. But you could stop on the street and call someone from public telephone booths. By the s, many major cities across the world had such booths. In fact, this is how most people made calls. Only very rich people had telephones at home.Some years later, people wanted to use telephones while driving. So phones – complete with handsets and dials – were built into cars. But these car phones had no wires! They used radio waves to connect to other phones.In the s, a few people had phones that they could carry around in their bags. This was the satellite phone. It could connect to other phones using satellites. Satphones were never popular because they needed a clear lineofsight to a satellite in the sky. So if you lived on the second floor of a storey building, you would have to go up to the terrace to make or receive calls.Cell phones began to be used at around the same time. These did not need a straight connect with a satellite. They connected to a tower nearby. So you could make calls sitting inside your house or office. The first cell phone, made in , weighed more than one kilogram! Later, it got smaller and smaller until it could fit into your pocket.A cell phone is convenient in other ways too. Landline phones have to be connected with wires. This means a lot of digging to lay cables across and between towns. Since this also requires money, many villages did not have phones. But the wireless cell phone has changed that. Nearly everyone has a cell phone now.Today’s cell phones are for more than just making calls. You can chat, play games, send emails, browse the internet, listen to music, watch movies, click photos and record videos, download apps. . . What we call a smartphone is really a computer that can also make calls. What else could a phone of the future do?Today, you can speak out your friend’s name and your phone will call her up. Maybe one day you would be able to tell your phone, “Find me the number of my third standard math teacher,” and it would! The phone might be able to beam out threedimensional images of objects. So you can look at a school bag from every side before you buy it online. On the inside too! I also imagine these phones as bendy. You can wrap them around your wrist or roll them up to fit a tiny purse.And charging! There has to be a better way to do that. Solar cells would be great – you would only have to be out in the sun to charge it. Or motionbased charging. This would use kinetic energy, which means that the phone would keep getting charged as long as it was on the move. If the battery was dying, you could take a quick run down the road. The phone would get charged and you would get some exercise.Smartphones become outdated very quickly! Most people throw away their phones in one or two years to buy newer ones. That means a lot of waste. How nice it would be if phones were earthfriendly. No harmful radiation, no toxic materials – all reusable or biodegradable parts. Now, that’s really smart technology! Now, tell me, what do you think phones will be like in the future?Inventor and Teacher Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone. Other scientists also worked on similar inventions. Bell’s parents inspired him to learn about sound and speech. His father was a professor of elocution. Alexander’s mother was almost completely deaf, but she learnt to play the piano. Alexander used to speak close to her forehead so that she could feel the vibrations and make out the words. He later started a school for the deaf in Boston. Throughout his life, Alexander kept discovering new ways to communicate. He had  patents to his name. His first invention, as a yearold, was a machine to remove husk from wheat grains.Bell was fascinated by the way sound travels through vibrations. If you place your fingers on your throat and speak, you can feel the vibrations of your vocal chords that make the sound. When someone speaks, the vibrations reach your ears and make the eardrum vibrate. That’s how you hear things. As people move farther away, the vibrations become weaker and fade out.See the Sound! An experiment Things you need:   bowl  Plastic cling wrap  A few grains of rice  A steel plate and spoon Steps: . Take the bowl and stretch a plastic cling wrap tightly over it. Make sure it doesn’t sag. . Sprinkle a few grains of rice on the plastic film. . Take the steel plate and spoon, go close to the bowl with the plastic film, but don’t touch it. . Start hitting the plate with the spoon. But be careful not to touch the bowl! What do you see?	./Story text files/149.txt	6853	20	5.943148688046647	544	142	137	57.08474576271186	52	66	27	11.5	40	78	359	327	6	1.4517374517374517	677	100
Have you heard of the World Wide Web? No? Never mind. Now, have you heard of the Internet? Yes? Great! But what IS the Internet? Did you say “I am not quite sure, but I know it has something to do with computers” ? You’re right – it does. But that’s not the whole answer. What’s the WHOLE answer then? Hmmm. We need an EXPERT to answer that. And guess what  I know JUST the person! She’s usually to be found near a computer, so let’s go straight to the computer now.Hi Nettikutti! Here is a group of kids to meet you! Come on out, come on out, wherever you are! THERE you are! Go on, kids, say hello! And don’t be fooled by her cuteness and her size – she holds a LOT of information in her little head!So Nettikutti, here’s what everyone wants to know  What IS the Internet? Ooooh. BIG question. Let’s see how I can put it simply. The Internet (short for ‘INTERconnected NETworks’) is a large, large, LARGE collection of computers from all over the world that are connected to each other.The computers could be gigantic computers (the kind research laboratories or governments own), desktop computers (the kind you see in banks and computer centres), laptops (the kind people sling across their shoulders and carry with them), cellphones (the kind that ring so loudly and annoyingly in movie halls), and even the little music players with the itty bitty headphones that seem to grow out of people's ears.All these computers are connected with each other either by real wires and cables  cables that run above the ground, underground, even under the sea (big computers)  OR by wireless signals (laptops, cellphones, music players). So you see, you don’t have to be sitting in one place and have your computer plugged into an electric socket to be on the Internet – you can even be connected to the world while you are on the move!That’s it? We thought the Internet was about talking to friends and downloading film songs and booking movie tickets and looking for information for school projects and finding the telephone number of a hospital! But that's not the Internet. All THAT is part of something truly magical, something called… wait for it…. the World Wide Web! This World Wide Web  let’s call it W for short – is a large, large, LARGE collection of what are called PAGES (there are some  BILLION public pages on the W now! ).A page could contain information in the form of words, numbers, photographs, songs, video clips, and more. This collection of pages (or the W) ‘sits’ on the Internet, in those millions of computers and cell phones and music players. The Internet is a network of networks made up of computers, laptops, tablets and mobile phones. W is a collection of connected pages, that is on the Internet. So the W is NOT the Internet itself, but one PART of it, the coolest part. If you think of the Internet as a restaurant, then the W is the most popular dish on the menu. And the spoon that helps you dig into this dish and get to your favourite bits of it is called a ‘Web Browser’.Oooooh! Now you’ve made us hungry, Nettikutti! But do tell us more about what makes the W so popular. Sure! The W is superexciting because it includes: Email – which allows you to send letters to anyone anywhere in the world – and have them receive it in under a minute! The same letter – if you were sending it to someone in America, say, would have taken  days to reach him if you had mailed it through a post office. And it would have cost you a lot of money too. But email is free!Search – which helps you find useful – and useless! – information on a million different subjects. You may want to know which states the River Ganga flows through, or see what the Statue of Liberty looks like. You may want to hear the latest film song of your favourite actor, or watch an episode of a serial that you missed. You may want to find out the score in the T World Cup, or see if there are tickets available on the MumbaiPune train tomorrow. If someone whose computer is connected to the Internet, somewhere in the world, has decided to share this information with the world and put it on the W, you will be able to find it  instantly! And for free!But Nettikutti, HOW do you find the page that you want, out of all those billions of pages? Easy! Each page also has a unique ‘address’ which helps your Web Browser find it, just like your home address helps the postman to find your house. So if you know the page’s address, you can go to it immediately. What if you don’t know the page’s address? No problem! You can use a wonderful service called a ‘Search Engine’, which also sits on the W, to help you.Sharing – which helps you share ANYTHING you want – a song you love, your dog’s picture, a clever way to solve a difficult maths problem, your big idea for keeping our streets free of litter – with everyone in the world! No single person owns the Internet or the W, and no government has authority over it*, so you don’t need to ask ANYONE for permission before you share. Think about how cool that is! Until now, you had books and movies and television and newspapers giving you information, ‘talking’ to you, but YOU couldn’t talk back to THEM. With the W, everything has changed – you can listen, and YOU CAN HAVE YOUR SAY too. And you don’t have to be an important person or a grownup to do this. THIS is what makes the W so fantastic – it is a truly free and open AND democratic system – it gives EVERYONE who is connected to the Internet a VOICE. *Governments do 'control' the internet in their own countries, however. Governments can even 'switch off' the internet, so that their citizens cannot access it, and some have actually done so for short or long periods.Wow! That’s great, Nettikutti! Now, on a completely different tack – we understand why the first two Ws in W stand for World Wide, but why is it called a Web? Isn’t it the INTERNET that is actually a web? Good question! You’re right about the Internet being a web (because of all those computers being connected to each other), but SO IS THE W. Let me explain. Remember those billions of pages that the W is made of? THEY are all connected, or ‘hyperlinked’, to each other as well! That means you can go from one page to another almost endlessly! Do you see now how the W is ALSO a web, a HUMUNGOUS web of knowledge and information and entertainment for all humankind to enjoy and use?We do, we do! Now we have to have to have to know  who was the superbrain who came up with such a wonderful idea? I thought you’d never ask! For the answer to that question, we have to go back in time some  years, to a nuclear research laboratory called CERN in Switzerland. Many scientists there, and across other labs in Europe, were working on projects together, but there was no way to share their work with each other quickly and easily. They would have to actually travel to each others' labs, or use the post office and courier services, to let their teams know how far they had progressed.One of the scientists at CERN, Tim BernersLee, was getting a little fed up of this, so he decided to figure out a way to share information better and faster. He came up with a big idea called ‘hypertext’ – a way of linking information on computers together – to do this. The idea worked really well for CERN, and everyone was really happy. And THEN  Tim BernersLee had his SECOND big idea.He felt his invention would benefit other people as well, and that it would be selfish to limit it to CERN. He talked to the authorities at CERN, and persuaded them to let him share the idea of hypertext with other scientists all over the world, for free. They agreed! Berners Lee shared his idea, and urged everyone he shared it with to improve it or add to it as they wished. The idea of being able to access and share information from anywhere on earth instantly was SO powerful and SO attractive that a LOT of people began to use hypertext. Since anyone could use their own ideas to make it better, people all over the world felt they 'owned' the internet, that it was THEIRS. Which was a wonderful thing.By , the W had EXPLODED, with millions of people beginning to use it. Today, more than TWO BILLION people use the W in some way – that is almost onethird of all the human beings on the planet! Hmmmm. Life would be very different today if Tim Berners Lee had decided not to be so generous, right? Absolutely! So don’t you think we should cheer both him and the W with a big Hip, Hip Hurray? We should! We should, Nettikutti! Here we go. To BernersLee and the W  Hip Hip. . . . . . HURRAYYYYYY!	./Story text files/366.txt	8549	16	5.8597339782345825	614	213	415	70.84873949579831	59	60	67	14.378151260504202	50	69	438	389	5	1.532972972972973	750	175

No part of this text may be reproduced for commercial use without express permission of the author. For Jacques and SonjaMac was a very big dog. Mac lived in a house with a very small kitchen, where Mac loved to sleep on the cool floor. This caused lots of problems.Mrs Smith would come into the kitchen and ask, “Why have I got such a large dog in the middle of my very small kitchen?” Mac would see he wasn't wanted, and slink away to the hall where the floor was almost as cool, but the smells weren't as nice.Just when Mac had begun to settle down Baby Katia came crawling along the floor of the hall. She bumped into Mac, and let out a small squeal, ” EEEIKK. ” . Mrs Smith looked over and threw her hands up in the air again, saying, “Why have I got such a big dog in my small passage way?” Picking up the baby she chased Mac out of the hall.Mac looked up with droopy Mac eyes, and saw he was not wanted there either, and decided to slink away to the bathroom. In the shower the floor was always cool, sometimes a little damp, but always perfectly shaded for snoozing. Mac didn't like the soap smell, but he thought maybe at least I'll be safe here out of the way for a while.Right at that moment, Katia's big brother Tyron, who hated getting up too early in the morning, choose to get up and wandered down stairs to have a shower. When Tyron saw Mac in the shower he said to him, “Mac, I am happy for you to have a shower with me, but I don't think you are going to like it.” Mac looked up at Tyron with his big droopy Mac eyes, and rumbled a Mac rumble, ” GRMMRMRL.”Mac tried to decide if Tyron wanted him to go or stay. He paused in thought, half standing up and half lying down in the shower. Tyron said: “Mac if you don't believe me I can show you.” He turned the tap on very softly to let Mac know what might be coming.Mac suddenly felt something cold and wet, he looked at Tyron a bit startled. Then he realized Tyron was just warning him there was more coming and he wouldn't much like it, and perhaps he better go. So he ambled back to the hall – looked around to see if the 'coast was clear', and sunk down into his favorite snooze position.The coast was not clear for long, Mr Smith came back from reading his paper and saw Mac. “Mac, old boy, why do you, such a big dog, choose to sit in such a small passage?” he asked. “You know you shouldn't be here, Mrs Smith will find you and you don't want that do you?” Mac looked up with his big droopy Mac eyes, and rumbled softer this time. . . . “Grmmgrl.”Mac didn't know what to do now, it was hot outside, and the new puppy would be out there and want to play. Mac didn't want to play now, he wanted to sleep. The only place Mac could go for really good shade was on the balcony, but he was afraid of climbing up the stairs. The stairs were so BIG and STEEP and SCARY looking.He tried to slink back to the kitchen, but Mrs Smith spied him creeping in, “Mac, why do I have such a big dog trying to creep into my small kitchen again?” She threw her hands up again, for the third time that morning. “Mac what will I do with you?  Outside now!”It was getting closer to midday, and it was getting hotter by the second. Mac wished he didn't have a fur coat. There were lots of trees to lie under, but the ground was all prickly and Mac didn't like it. He looked at the stairs, he wanted to go up and lie under the table on the cool balcony floor, but they were terrifying. They were so big and steep, he didn't know how he would come down. Maybe he would get stuck up there, and if no one found him he might miss his dinner. Or maybe his legs would fall through the gaps and he would be trapped, Then the Cat would taunt and tease him until someone came to the rescue.While thinking of all the terrible things that might happen if he tried, he slowly ambled over to his least hated tree where he lay down in the prickly grass. Soon after he lay down to snooze, the new puppy came bounding up to him. “Whatchya doing Mac? Watchya doing?” “GrrrrrrMm” . Said Mac. “Whatchya doing Mac? Watchya doing? !” “GRRMMMLL” Said Mac, this time in a more menacing Growly voice. The puppy should know what that meant, he thought.But noooo. . . The puppy was young and very eager but not yet very bright, “Mac – watcha doing, don't ya wanna come and play with me?” She said, still waiting expectantly for a reply. Mac tried to ignore the puppy and rolled over to face the tree.“Mac, I'm gonna go chase the Cat – I saw him just now. Mac don't you wanna chase the Cat with me?” Mac put his paws over his head and pretended not to see or hear. She just ran up the stairs on to the balcony, if you wanna come with me, I think she's trapped up there.”Mac was going to roll over again when his ears pricked up as he caught the word 'Balcony'. “Little Dipper” , he said slowly in a bit of a mumble grumble, not wanting to sound too interested, ” Do you know how to get on to the balcony?”Little Dipper didn't quite understand what he said because he was mumbling, but was so surprised and glad that Big Mac was talking to her she was eager to give a good answer. ” Sure I do” , she replied. ” So how do you?” asked Mac. ” How do you what?” replied Little Dipper ” How do you get onto the balcony?” asked Mac. ” Well by the stairs of course” , replied Little Dipper.Mac shuddered a bit at the thought of the stairs, but tried not to let Dipper see. ” Well I know by the stairs, but how?” Mac asked. “Those stairs are awfully big, and you are so very small. And what if you can't get down again?” Mac inquired further. ” But I normally always get down – why shouldn't I?” replied Dipper. ” You always get down OK?” said Mac. ” Yep always” , said Dipper. “But how?” asked Mac.Dipper looked at Mac, she was only one and a half, turning two years old soon, but she had been climbing stairs ever since she could remember. She tried to think how she did it, but couldn't remember – she just did, and she found it difficult to understand why Mac was asking so many questions.Then she thought, maybe it's because he's never climbed the stairs. Dipper thought very hard, and very long, until she decided for sure she had never seen Mac climb the stairs. “Mac” , she said, ” do you want me to show you how I climb the stairs?” Mac, coughed a little, and mumbled, “ “Grmmbl, er, well I would. But just to make sure you don't hurt yourself or get stuck.” Then he added, “You better show me a few times, to make really sure.”Dipper agreed, and they walked off together for the first time since she could remember. Mac, pleased that Dipper would show him the stairs, and Dipper, pleased that Mac wanted to play with her at last.At the top of the stairs they settled down under the table on the cool balcony floor. The Cat was gone, but Mac and Dipper had both forgotten. They lounged down in their favourite snooze positions and dreamed of pleasant doggy things.The EndMORE BOOKS!

Flying across the morning sky, Are birds in a hungry mood. Spot the one who has caught, A yummy worm for its food!Butterflies of different colours, Are flitting flower to flower. But there’s one that stands out, Because it’s one colour all over.A cheerful bunch of kites, Are merrily hopping about. But one’s not quite the same, Can you find the odd one out?Big and small squares, Are shapes you see everywhere. There’s one grill that’s different, Where is it hidden, here or there?Look among the green leaves, Of this big, old tree. There’s a branch with a speck of colour, Wherever can it be?Planes flying across the sky, Leave behind a straight trail. But one of them is rather odd, And instead makes a curvy tail.A line of chattering birds, Are sitting above, can you see? But one likes to be quiet, Whoever could it be?A flock of white clouds, Are gleaming on a bright summer day. But one decides to be rainy, And doesn’t care what the others say.A long day is done, And the night has just begun. Of all the street lights, Find the one shining like the sun.Bats sleep when the sun is out, And wake up when it's night. Can you find the odd one, Who is still sleeping tight?Outer space has many planets, That are shiny and brightly lit. Spot the one that’s unique, Because it has a ring around it.	./Story text files/533.txt	1300	16	5.661870503597123	120	19	70	55.56521739130435	3	20	14	11.304347826086957	1	22	84	55	4	1.38	140	10
Toktok toktok! Raja Petuchand of Sonapur buried his head under the pillow. The butter chicken he had enjoyed a little too much last night was already giving him trouble. Now this awful noise!“Do you have to get the palace work done at this hour?” he grumbled to queen Suruchi. But she was snoring peacefully next to him in the kingsized bed, dreaming of the next palace festival. Toktok… toktok!“What nonsense!” said Petuchand. “I am the king and I forbid this tok, tok sound!” He got up and opened the door, adjusting the royal robes around his ample stomach. The sentries were looking around nervously.“What is this commotion?” the king asked his bodyguards angrily. “No idea, sire,” said the guards, shaking a little bit. “We’ve been searching for the person making the noise. But we have not found anything.” “Idiots,” the king grumbled under his breath. “If you don’t find out what it is in the next five minutes, I’m firing all of you,” he shouted. Toktok… toktok!Immediately the guards called Ranveer Singh, the captain of the army. He was six feet tall and three feet wide and his long curling mustache frightened everybody.“Sir, please help us find what is making this toktok sound or we will all lose our jobs,” they pleaded with him. “Fools!” Ranveer Singh muttered. He collected a platoon of soldiers. Toktok… toktok! “Ready, men? Go find this intruder right now!” he ordered. The men marched all around the palace searching, searching, searching.They looked into all the windows, scaring the sleeping children. They opened all the boxes and tapped all the walls, creating so much noise themselves that nobody in the palace got any sleep that night. Toktok tok tok!The next morning the king overslept and was late to the durbar. His first case was about two men who said they owned the same cow. “It’s mine,” said the first man. “No, I’ve been milking her for two years,” said the other.“Oh, really? I’ve been offering sweets made from her milk to the goddess for the last three years,” said the first. “My head hurts,” said the king to his prime minister, Chintamani.“And last night’s butter chicken is still squawking in my stomach. Just cut the cow in two and give half to each. I want them to stop complaining.” “Uh sire, it is a cow,” whispered Chintamani. “Cutting it in two might not be a good idea.” One of his jobs was to make sure the king did not issue any crazy orders, which Petuchand was quite capable of doing when he was hungry or tired. The worry had made Chintamani bald before his time.“Of course,” said the king, slapping his forehead. “Well, how am I supposed to be a just and wise king when I haven’t slept all night?” Raja Petuchand told Chintamani about the toktok sound. “I have just the person to help,” said the minister with a smile of relief.That night he bought Pasupati the zookeeper to the palace after everyone had gone to bed. Toktok toktok! When the zookeeper heard the sound he rushed home and brought back a cage and a bowl of worms. Pasupati then had the royal carpenter cut a hole in the wall nearest the sound. He put the bowl of worms near the hole. Everybody stepped back and waited silently.A small red and brown bird with a long yellow beak stepped out of the hole and jumped into the bowl. Swoosh! The bird was in the cage. The king was amazed. “Such a tiny bird and such a loud noise! Thank you everyone. You have done a great service to the country.” The next morning the king reached the durbar bright and early. Pasupati the zookeeper was standing in front of him. “Sire, I cannot keep the bird.”“What happened?” asked the king. “The toktok noise kept all the animals in the zoo awake. They are all sleeping now and the children visiting the zoo are very disappointed.” “Hmmm,” said the king. He wondered if the bird would make a good cutlet. “No sir, we cannot kill the bird,” said Chintamani firmly. He was good at guessing the king’s thoughts. “It is very rare and must be considered a lucky bird.”“Then what do we do?” asked the king. “If the animals cannot bear the noise then my citizens certainly cannot. And we cannot have a country full of sleepless people.” Another minister stepped forward bravely. “Sire, I would be willing to keep the bird. I have a newborn baby boy and his crying keeps us up at night anyway.” “No, no, we need to find a better place,” said Chintamani.“Aha!” he exclaimed suddenly. “We need to find a place for the toktok bird where nobody must sleep at night. I have the perfect plan, sire!” he said.And that is how the toktok bird ended far away from the palace and the towns of Sonapur, giving company to the border patrol. It kept the soldiers awake every night and did its job so well that it became the official bird of the country. The kingdom’s enemies could never get by the alert Sonapur soldiers and grumbled that the country should change its name to Jaagpur instead.	./Story text files/243.txt	4871	18	5.952095808383233	393	108	146	50.28421052631579	52	43	30	10.115789473684211	42	53	283	218	5	1.4623287671232876	509	75
Avanti was the zookeeper of Pitara zoo. There were many, many animals in Pitara, but Avanti's best friend was Ballu, the bear. Ballu was big, brown and strong. On his fourth birthday, Avanti organised a little party for Ballu.“Ballu, can you blow out all the candles at once?” Avanti asked. “Of course!” said Ballu. He filled his chest with air. He huffed and puffed and puffed and huffed and went “WHOOSH!”The blast of air blew the candles out. Then rising up, it crashed into the clouds in the sky. And all of a sudden, there was was a roar of thunder and it started to rain.“Hey, it’s raining fish,” Avanti shouted. Ballu looked around with wonder. Then he picked up a huge basket and ran around collecting fish as they fell from the sky. Every time the basket filled, he dropped the fish in a little pond and ran back for more.Then, as he was rushing for the tenth time to the pond, he turned back. The water level had risen and he could see that Avanti was scared.Ballu came back quickly, picked Avanti up and placed her on his shoulders. Avanti put her arms around Ballu's neck and thanked him. Soon, the clouds disappeared and the sun came out. It was bright and cheerful once again.“I will never again ask you to blow the candles out,” said Avanti. “Why?” asked Ballu. “Who knows? Next time it might start raining frogs,” Avanti said and the two friends started laughing.	./Story text files/344.txt	1379	13	5.755102040816326	129	18	90	46.58620689655172	15	14	19	9.551724137931034	14	15	90	57	4	1.4437869822485208	151	18

Sitara has a hobby. Playing, helping her parents, dreaming of flying cows or upsidedown owls, she always sucks her thumb.One hot summer day, she is reading her favourite book about a child who set up home in an ice bucket. Usually, when Sitara wants to know the meaning of a big word in a story, she asks her father.But today Papa asks her, “What is the meaning of adventure?” “Doing something exciting,” says Sitara. “What is the meaning of magnificent?” asks Papa. “Very beautiful,” says Sitara. “What is the meaning of monument?” “A grand thing.”“Good,” says Papa. “Now listen to me. We are going on an adventure. Next week, we’ll take a train to see a magnificent monument. The Taj Mahal.” Sitara is so happy she forgets to suck her thumb. She can draw a train but she has never been on one!“But,” says Papa, “children who suck their thumbs are not allowed on trains.” How can that be! Sitara decides to talk to her mother about it.“Ma, we are going to see the Taj Mahal,” she says. “Yes,” says Ma. “Do you know what it is? ’ “Something magnificient that you go to see in a train,” says Sitara. “Four hundred years ago a king brought together twenty thousand people to make it,” says Ma. “But children who suck their thumbs are not allowed on trains.”Sitara is miserable. Twenty thousand people! Four hundred years! She wants to see the Taj Mahal.Sitara goes to bed and dreams she is all alone. Everyone else has gone on the holiday. But look, what is Chotu doing?Sitara wakes up and shouts, “You fooled me!” She runs to her parents. “Chotu also sucks his thumb,” she yells at them. “How can he go on the train?” “Dinner is ready,” says Ma.Papa says, “You will be grown up soon, Sitara.” Ma says, “Grownups need both their hands.” Sitara asks, “What do grownups need both their hands for?”“You need both your hands to tie your shoelaces with,” says Ma. “You need both your hands to shell peas with or peel potatoes,” says Papa.“I am grown up! I can do those things,” says Sitara. “Then show us you are grown up,” says Papa. Ma says, “Please take your thumb out of your mouth, Sitara.”Papa says, “You need both your hands to…” “I know,” says Sitara. “I need both my hands to bat. I need both my hands to plait Ma’s hair. I need both my hands to hold a skipping rope.”“I need both my hands to make a string butterfly. I need both my hands to pretend I am an aeroplane. I need both my hands to stand on my head.

"Here is a feather and here is a stone. Which is heavy and which is light? What a silly question, you say. The stone is heavy and the feather is light, of course!Here is an elephant and here is the same stone. Which is heavy and which is light? What an absurd question, you say. The elephant is heavy and the stone is light, of course!Wait, didn’t you just say that the stone was heavy? Yes, that was because it was heavier than the feather! But it is MUCH lighter than an elephant.So maybe it is best not to say, “This is heavy” or “This is light” . Maybe it is better to ask: Is this heaviER than something else? Is this lightER than something else?But what about the question  How heavy is this stone? Can we find the answer without talking about elephants or feathers? Yes, we can! We can compare the stone to something called a kilogram*. A kilogram is used to find out how heavy or light a thing is. A good question to ask then is  How much heavier than a kilogram is the stone? Or How much lighter than a kilogram is our stone? *A ‘kilogram’ is the same thing as ‘kilo’ or ‘kg’. From now on, let’s say kg when we mean kilogram  it’s shorter.But how heavy is a kg? Let's see. You tell the vegetable vendor at the market, “Please give me  kg of onions. "" The vendor puts a kg weight on one side of the scale and piles onions on the other side until the two sides are level. You count the onions on the scale. There are  onions. That tells you that  kg is as heavy as  onions. But this is not entirely reliable. When the onions are small,  kg may be as heavy as  onions. When they are big,  kg may be only as heavy as  onions.We need to find something that weighs EXACTLY  kg. I know! A litre bottle of water weighs exactly  kg! Now that we know this, let’s get back to our elephant. How heavy is an elephant in kgs? Around ,  kg! So if you could get an elephant to sit on one side of a pair of scales, you would need a whopping ,  litre water bottles to balance its weight.,  kg is also the weight of  cows, or  mediumsized dogs!Now that we have talked about some Very Heavy things, let us ask a bolder question  How heavy is the earth? The earth, including all the creatures in it, weighs . . .. . . , , , , , , , ,  kgs! Or as much as , , , , , , , ,  litre water bottles! That is very, VERY heavy! Even if we used all the water on earth, there would not be enough to fill them all!Uff. This conversation is getting too heavy! Let us bring the feather back. How light is a feather? It is roughly , ,  times lighter than a kg. If you put a litre water bottle on one side of a scale, you will need to put about , ,  feathers on the other side to make the two sides balance.A raindrop is about ,  times lighter than a kg. Roughly ,  raindrops will weigh as much as a litre bottle of water! A grain of salt is about , , ,  (two crore) times lighter than a kg. That is very, VERY light!Phew! You must be feeling quite lightheaded now. And your brain must be buzzing with questions. Questions like: How do we weigh a grain of sand? How on earth did people weigh the earth? Who decided the weight of  kg? Bet you can’t wait to find the answers when you grow up!Guesstimate It! Perfect for both classroom and home, this activity will help children get a feel for weight estimation. You will need:  A pair of scales with two pans and weights*  A litre bottle filled with water  Objects of different weights found in school or at home  a small bag of vegetables, a book, a duster, a packet of rice, and so on. What to do: . Pass the bottle of water around the class asking each child to feel its weight. This gives them a sense of how heavy a kg is. . Pass the other objects around one by one, asking each child if the object feels heavier or lighter than  kg. Also ask each to guess the actual weight of each object and write it on the board. . Weigh each object on the scales, first against the litre bottle (to answer the question 'Is it heavier or lighter than  kg? ') and then against the actual weights, to see how good each child's guesstimate was. *If it is difficult to find a pair of scales, invite the local vegetable vendor to your classroom (with his scales! ). In Step  above, pass bags of vegetables (of different weights) around.Think About It! . On page , you found out that a litre bottle of water weighs exactly  kg. How many water bottles would add up to YOUR weight? . You now know that an averagesized Indian elephant weighs about ,  kgs. If we told you that a train loaded with passengers weighs the same as  elephants, can you find out how many kgs it weighs? . Which is heavier –  kg of iron or  kg of cotton wool?Answers: . , ,  (ten lakh) kgs ( x  = , , ) . They are both EQUALLY heavy because both weigh the same –  kg! But  kg of cotton wool would take up a LOT more space than  kg of iron."	./Story text files/147.txt	4815	14	5.087209302325581	443	73	225	48.142857142857146	54	44	49	11.142857142857142	39	59	314	202	6	1.1765625	596	44
“Tejas! Look at what I have made!” Mirium tells her brother. “Oho, what is this?” asks Tejas. “The tiger does not live in the snow! How silly!” “Grrrrr, grrrr, grrrr, it does!” says Mirium. “There is a tiger in Russia that lives and hunts in the snow.” “Is that so?” says Tejas. “Let’s check it out. Pass me my magic glasses, Mirium!”“Ooh, you’re right, Mirium,” he said. “I can see the tiger! It is furrier. Maybe because it is so cold there.” “The Siberian tiger is different from the Bengal tiger you find in India, though they look similar,” says Mirium. “It only lives in one part of the world. Just like we love our own home, each animal also loves its own special home and does not like other places,” says Tejas.“I want to see it! I want to see it!” squeals Mirium. “Wait, wait,” says Tejas, laughing. “This isn’t high enough for you. I have an idea.” Tejas drags a table and Mirum climbs on top of it. “From here we can see many more animals living in their homes around the planet,” says Tejas. “Durgesh! Mahima! Come join us!” yells Mirium, calling out to her friends who are passing by.“Ooh, what is that? It looks like a sword in the water,” says Durgesh, clambering on top of a bucket. “That,” says Mirium, “is the unicorn of the sea. It only lives in the waters in the northernmost part of our earth, the Arctic. It is cold and dark but home for the narwhals.” “How do you know so much, hmm?” asks Tejas, smiling. Mirium shrugs and says, “Books.”“Oh! Oh!” Mahima jumps up and says, “I read this story about an animal called the orangutan. But I don’t know what it looks like.” “The great ape of Indonesia and Malaysia,” says Mirum, swinging her glasses towards the east. “Here you go!” Mahima squeals, “The orangutan is eating a fruit, and has a baby that is just like me!”“Okay, okay, now a quick question,” says Tejas. “Can anyone tell me what this animal is?” Durgesh says, “Zebra!” Mirium says, “A deer!” Mahima says, “A buffalo!”Tejas giggles. “None of those! It is the okapi that lives only in a few forests of Africa.”Durgesh looks up and says, “Can I have another turn?” “Sure!” says Tejas. “What… what is that? It has strange blue feet!” “Let me see,” says Mirium, pulling at the glasses. “Aah yes, that is the bluefooted booby. A fantastic bird that lives in South America and does funny dances.”“It is getting dark now. I am hungry!” says Mirium. “Noooooooo. One more! One more!” everyone says. “Okay, then one last one,” Tejas says. Durgesh says with a grin, “I have an extra special animal in mind. So, two more.” Tejas says, “Look at this. This is the kiwi bird from New Zealand in the southern hemisphere. They are the only birds to have noseholes, just like ours, at the end of their very long beaks. They dig and use their noses to find insects and fruit to eat.”“Thank you!” says Durgesh. “Also, my mother told me this story once. I think it was about a. . a… loris.” “Aah, yes, the Sri Lankan loris. It has beautiful silver hair on its tummy and eyes in the front, just like us,” says Mirium. “But we cannot see it now. It is active in the night.” “But we can always come back tomorrow!” says Mahima. “Okay!” Tejas claps his hands. “Time for us and the animals to go home.” “Do you think all the animals are going home too?” “Yes, Mirium. Each one to its own special home in a unique part of our world.”The seven animals you have met live in different parts of the world. Here’s a map that shows you where they live. You may not have magic glasses like Tejas, but you can still see the animals here. Map not to scaleNarwhal: These sea animals live in icy Arctic waters. Found in Canada, Greenland, Norway and Russia. Kiwi: These birds live in a range of habitats from woodlands to scrubland, sand dunes and mangroves. Found in New Zealand. Sri Lankan loris: Also called the red slender loris, this shy creature lives in trees in wet, tropical areas. Found in Sri Lanka. Siberian tiger: This big cat lives in mixed forest, which are often very cold. Found in Russia and China.Okapi: This creature likes dense forests. Found in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Orangutan: These primates spend their whole lives atop rainforest trees. Found in Malaysia and Indonesia. Bluefooted booby: Most of these birds live on the Galapagos Islands. Also found in California and Peru.	./Story text files/526.txt	4303	15	5.620833333333334	407	73	120	36.75438596491228	84	30	24	7.815789473684211	75	39	274	206	4	1.3738977072310405	512	55

"When Rohan woke up, he began to play with Jimmy, his dog. “There’s something you should do first!” said Riya, his big sister. “BRUSH YOUR TEETH!” WOOF!“I don’t want to brush my teeth! Jimmy doesn’t brush his teeth!” “Animals take care of their teeth too, but in other ways! We must brush our teeth to keep germs away!” “Germs?” “Germs are very tiny creatures that you cannot see. If you don’t brush properly, they stay in your mouth and hurt you!” “Ouch!” “YES! That’s why we must take good care of our teeth by brushing twice a day  morning and night!” “But brushing is no fun!” “I’ll tell you a secret, Rohan! Psst…” Rohan smiled.Mummy called out, “It’s breakfast time!” “There’s something we should do first!” said Riya. “WASH OUR HANDS!” WOOF!“But Jimmy never washes his hands!” Riya laughed, “He doesn’t use his hands or paws to eat like we do! We must wash our hands with soap to get rid of germs.” “Are germs on our hands too?” “Germs are EVERYWHERE!” WOOF! “Aaaahchhhooo!” Riya covered her mouth with her hands as she sneezed. “Don't do that! My teacher says that we should sneeze into our sleeve, not our hands! "" said Rohan. “Why?” “Because when we sneeze into our hands, germs stick to them. If we don’t wash our hands, we spread germs and make others sick!”“Here comes Germy!” Riya shouted, chasing Rohan and waving her dirty hands. “EEEEEEEK!” WOOF!Later Riya showed Rohan the proper way to wash hands. “Wet your hands and turn off the tap. Then rub in some soap on the palms, the back of the hands and between the fingers. Scrub hands for twenty seconds! Now, it’s time to rinse off and dry!” “But that’s a long time!” “Remember my secret?” Rohan smiled.When they came back home after playing, Riya nudged Rohan, “There’s something we should do first!” Mummy teased, “Play some more?” “TAKE A BATH!” “Mummy, don’t you know that germs are everywhere? We can’t see them, but they stick to our skin and clothes!” “That’s why we must bathe every day…” “…to get rid of them!”""Start by getting yourself wet,” said Mummy. “Then apply soap all over!” Riya and Rohan giggled as Mummy’s ticklish fingers soaped them up. “Then it’s time to rinse off!” “And dry with a clean towel!” “SUPERCLEAN!” WOOF! “It’s Jimmy’s turn next!”“Do you want to listen to a story?” asked Papa.“There’s something we should do first!” reminded Riya. “Tidy UP!” Rohan yawned. “Do we have to?” “Remember you couldn’t find your ball the other day? Putting things away in the proper place makes it easy to find them later!” “And keeps our house neat!” “You both are so smart!” said Papa proudly. “Bedtime!” “Papa! There’s something we should do first!” said Riya, pulling Rohan along. “Make the germs disappear with our magic secret!” Rohan nodded.A few minutes later, Mummy and Papa heard a familiar tune. “So that’s your secret!” said Papa. “Humming a song to make brushing fun!” “And while washing our hands too!” “That’s a great idea!” said Mummy. WOOF! Rohan and Riya enjoy taking care of themselves. Do you? They make up a game with the germs and guess who wins?Germs say, yucky, mucky and dirty is FUN! I say, I brush and wash and I know I have won! Germs say, never bathe, it’s a waste of time! I say, smelling nice with soap is so fine. Naughty germ says don’t pick up your things, The house looks better that way. I say, I tidy up because I like my things That is a good way to end my day! And I feel better in every way I feel better in every way! I FEEL BETTER IN EVERY WAY! ! ! ! !

Rose came home from school with a new idea. “Appa! I know how to make compost!”“What is compost?” asked Appa, scratching his head. “Can I make it in the backyard, Appa?” Rose asked, tugging Rocky’s ear. “But what is compost?” Appa asked, scratching his ear.“It’s what plants eat, Appa,” said Rose. It makes them grow tall and strong.” “Baaaaa! Even I knew that!” bleated Rocky. Appa looked worried. “Oh! Don’t worry, Appa. We only need waste to make compost.”Off they ran to the backyard, and dug a hole. “Do you know what we need for compost, Rocky?”“We need lots of vegetable and fruit peels.

Fati was a little girl who ran like the wind, who loved to laugh and who always tried hard to do as she was told.Today was Sports Day at school. Fati played football and ran in three races.After school, she walked home with her good friend Hawa. Hawa said, “Fati, you are a fast runner!”Fati arrived home and found her mother in the kitchen. She said, “Mother, good evening.” Fati’s mother replied, “Fine evening. How are you?”Fati said, “We had Sports Day at school, and I ran very fast. I am hot, tired and very hungry.”Mother laughed and said, “My dear little Fati, you were born with fast legs! I will make okro soup and dinner will be ready soon.”Mother put some palm oil in a big cooking pot and placed it on the fire. When the oil was hot, she added onions and garlic and stirred them until they were soft. She then put in pepper, tomatoes, added some water and six pieces of steamed cow meat.Mother said, “Fati, please help me to stir the soup.” Fati said,” Yes, Mother.”Fati stirred the soup once. She said, “This soup smells delicious.”Fati stirred the soup twice. She said, “This soup smells very delicious.”Fati stirred the soup three times. She said, “This soup smells very, very delicious.”Then, Fati looked at her mother. Mother was not looking her way. She was cutting green leaves for the soup.Fati took one piece of meat from the pot and ate it. Fati said, “Mmm. . .”Again, Fati looked at her mother. Her mother was not looking her way. She was cutting garden eggs for the soup.Fati quickly took a second piece of meat from the pot and ate it. Fati said, “Mmm. . . Mmm. . .”Once more, Fati looked at her mother. Her mother was not looking her way. She was cutting okro for the soup.Fati very quickly took a third piece of meat from the pot and ate that too! Fati said, “Mmm. . . Mmm. . . Mmm. . .”Soon, Mother came to the fire with the green leaves, garden eggs and okro. Fati was still holding the big wooden spoon.Mother smiled and said, “Thank you for helping to stir the soup Fati.” Fati did not know what to say.Mother put the green leaves, garden eggs and okro in the soup and took the spoon from Fati. She started to stir the soup.Mother looked into the pot. She could see the soup bubbling on the hot fire. Mother looked for the six pieces of meat in the pot. “One. . . two. . . three. . . ,” said Mother. Mother saw three pieces of meat and no more. Mother said nothing. Fati said nothing.When Mother served the soup, Fati did not get any meat. Fati said, “Mother, I am sorry. I will not do that again.” And she never did. And that was the end of that.	./Story text files/503.txt	2579	16	5.22	271	29	112	30.463414634146343	64	18	25	6.902439024390244	56	26	186	114	3	1.1675675675675676	363	7
Mother's song was soft and sweet. Chandu was listening to it. Chandu fell asleep. In his dream, he was flying.Flying, flying into a garden. Look! A butterfly, so pretty. The butterfly said, “Well, hello! How are you?” “Fine, thank you,” Chandu replied.Chandu flew a bit higher. Flying, flying. He flew into a sparrow. “Hi there! How do you do?” she asked. “Very well, thank you,” Chandu said.Then Chandu soared still higher. Flying, still flying, he met an eagle. “Hello friend! How are you?” the eagle asked. “I feel good,” replied Chandu.Chandu was flying higher and higher. It seemed so easy. Flying, flying. So high that he came up to an aeroplane. “Hey, Chandu, how do you do?” the aeroplane asked. “Fine. And safe journey!” Chandu quickly replied.Soon Chandu climbed higher than before. Flying and still flying. A rocket came to meet him. “Hello sir, how do you do?” the rocket shouted. “Very well,” Chandu smiled.Still, Chandu was flying higher and higher. Now the stars were twinkling all around. They were smiling at Chandu, as though he were a part of them. “How are you feeling Chandu?” one star asked him. “I am feeling great!” he said.

It was a very special day and so Raza was wearing his best clothes. Today, he was going to meet someone very important – His Majesty Jalaluddin Akbar, the great Mughal king! Raza’s father Rahmat Khan was an important man too. He was the royal tailor to the king, and he stitched all his angarakhas – the loose coats that the king wore over his tight churidar pyjamas. This morning they were going to the palace in Fatehpur Sikri with the angarakhas the king had ordered for summer. The king was very fussy about his clothes and it was very hard to please him.Rahmat Khan had worked hard to make the angarakhas – cutting and stitching late into the night. Raza had helped too – putting in tiny stitches using the finest needle and the best silken thread. The spring sun shone brightly, the flowers smiled, and the pigeons cooed happily as the two of them walked to the fortress of Fatehpur Sikri. Two soldiers holding spears stood guarding the gate. “I’m Rahmat Khan,” Raza’s father said, “I’m the angarakha maker to His Majesty and I’ve brought new sets for him.” “Is His Majesty expecting you?” the guard with big moustaches asked. “Ji huzoor. He chose the designs himself.” “Wait here,” the guard turned to go inside, “I’ll call the Royal Steward.”After a while the guard returned with another man. Rahmat bowed to him. “I’ve brought the summer clothes, Dhaniji,” he said. “Good! Come with me. His Majesty is still in his sleeping chamber. He’ll see you before he leaves for the royal court.” As they walked in, Raza whispered, “Who is he, Abbu?” “Dhani Singh. He works in the Khwabgah.” “Khwabgah?” “The king’s personal palace, where he has his sitting room and bedroom.” It was a long walk. Raza looked around, his eyes wide with wonder. The Mughal palaces were so beautiful! All made of red sandstone with slim carved pillars and curving arches.In between were gardens filled with flowers, lily pools and sparkling fountains. Raza thought he was in heaven. As they waited at the door of the king’s bedroom, Raza studied Dhani Singh. Being a tailor’s son, he noticed the clothes first. Dhani Singh was wearing a cotton angarakha in a red and white flowery print over white churidars. His nagra shoes had pointed toes that curved inward. He had tied a narrow cloth belt, a patka, at his waist. What Raza liked most was his bright red turban, printed with a design in white and yellow squares and dots.“Your turban is very nice, Dhaniji,” he said, “that’s a really pretty design!” “Thank you! I come from the land of the Rajputs and. . . this design, called bandhani, is from my homeland.” As they entered the room, Raza’s heart was thudding. Sunlight poured in through the arched doorways, lighting up the thick silken Persian carpet woven in jewelled colours. The room was furnished with a beautifully carved bed and exquisite chairs. There were silk and gold cushions on the low bed. Even the curtains were made of silk! Raza bowed and then looked at his king. Akbar was choosing jewellery from a box held before him by a servant.He was not very tall but he had the broad shoulders of a swordfighter. He had large, slightly slanted eyes, a drooping moustache, and a small mole above his lips. Hearing them enter, Akbar turned and smiled, “Ah Rahmat! You’ve brought the angarakhas? And who is this boy with you?” “My son Raza, huzoor.” “And can you stitch too, Raza?” “I’m learning, huzoor,” Raza replied nervously, “but I still make mistakes in cutting the cloth.” “You’ll learn. Your father will teach you,” Akbar said gently. Rahmat opened the bundle and laid out the angarakhas on the bed.They were made of the finest muslin and covered with delicate embroidery. All of them were in light summery colours – cream, lemon, pale blue, green and a sparkling white. Raza knew the king’s favourite colour was white. Rahmat helped Akbar put on a white angarakha. Then Dhani Singh brought a large mirror and held it before the king. “I like the embroidery. . . and it fits well too,” Akbar said, looking pleased. “Now tie a patka. Let’s see how it looks.” Rahmat took out a handful of belts and tied a light blue one around Akbar’s waist, letting the fringed ends hang in front. “No…” said Akbar moodily, “this is too pale… I want something brighter.”Raza and his father then tried one patka after another – green and yellow, orange and purple, but nothing pleased Akbar. “I don’t like any of the colours, Rahmat!” Akbar said, frowning impatiently. Raza saw that his father was beginning to look worried. Oh no! If His Majesty did not like the patkas, would he send all the clothes back? “I have to do something fast!” Raza thought. He looked around and said suddenly, “Huzoor, would you like to try a bright red one with a white and yellow design?” “What kind of red?” Akbar boomed. “Show me!” Raza pointed to Dhani Singh’s turban, “That red?” “Hmmm…” Akbar stared thoughtfully at Dhani Singh’s moustached face and said, “Let me give it a try.”In a flash, Raza had taken off Dhani Singh’s turban, unrolled it and tied it around Akbar’s waist. He waited with bated breath while Akbar studied his reflection in the mirror. He noticed Dhani Singh grinning widely – he must have been amused to see the king wearing his turban as a belt! “I like the colour… and a new design too!” Akbar said finally. “Bandhani, huzoor… from the land of the Rajputs,” said Raza promptly. “Aha! Rajput like my queen, Jodh Bai!” Akbar began to smile. “Dhani, pay Rahmat for the angarakhas and patkas. I’ll take them all!” “Huzoor,” asked Raza cautiously, “Dhaniji needs a turban. We’ve taken the one he was wearing.” “Give him a patka!” laughed Akbar. “That boring pale blue one. I am keeping his turban.”FUN FACTS OF HISTORY . Raza lived during the reign of King Akbar over  years ago. Akbar was the greatest king of the Mughal dynasty. He was also a famous warrior. He loved wearing clothes with new designs. He also enjoyed flying kites and eating mangoes!. Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty, was the king of Kabul. He invaded India in  and defeated the Sultan of Delhi, Ibrahim Lodi, at the Battle of Panipat. Akbar was Babur's grandson. He was an equally successful general and never lost a battle during his year rule. . Two Mughal kings built new cities. Akbar built Fatehpur Sikri near Agra and Shahjahan built Shahjahanabad in Delhi. Fatehpur Sikri lies empty today but Shahjahanabad (presentday Old Delhi) is full of life and people.. Shahjahan’s famous Peacock Throne was a square flat seat, with slim pillars at each corner covered with precious jewels. The seat had a canopy, which had the figure of a peacock studded with gems on top of it. The emperor sat under the canopy, leaning against silk cushions.. Many Mughal princesses were highly educated. Gulbadan Begum wrote the biography of her father, Babur. Shahjahan’s daughter Jahanara was a poet. . The Mughal fort had many kitchens. Each kitchen sent food for the king. So when he sat down to eat, he would have as many as thirty dishes to choose from! Lipsmacking Mughlai cusine, which includes yummy dishes like biryani, pulao, kalia and korma, originated in these kitchens.	./Story text files/326.txt	7129	14	5.884467265725289	634	145	141	51.043795620437955	72	65	28	10.08029197080292	59	78	380	399	5	1.512249443207127	791	107
One morning, Lindi found an elephant in her room. “Look!” she called. “There’s an elephant in my room!” “No there isn’t,” her mother called back. “Elephants don’t live in houses. Everybody knows that.” The elephant yawned.At breakfast, Lindi’s dad asked her to pass the milk. “I can’t,” said Lindi. “The elephant drank it all.” “There isn’t an elephant,” said her dad. “Elephants don’t live in the city. Everybody knows that.” The elephant burped.At school, the teacher grumbled, “What’s wrong with this chalkboard? It’s all wrinkly!” “That’s not the chalkboard. That’s my elephant!” said Lindi. “There are no elephants at school,” said the teacher. “Everybody knows that.” The elephant ate the teacher’s sandwiches.At breaktime, the elephant followed Lindi to the playground. He knocked over the swings by mistake. “Go away!” said Lindi. “You’re not real and you shouldn’t be here! Everybody knows that!” The elephant drooped. He walked away, wiping his eyes with his trunk.After school, Lindi couldn’t see the elephant anywhere. “Elephant!” she called. “Where are you?”Lindi went home without him. She felt lonely. So she went outside, and sat on the steps, and waited. And waited. And waited.And then … she saw a trunk. And tusks. And ears. The elephant was coming down the road!She ran up and hugged him. “I’m sorry,” she said. “I didn’t mean it! I know you’re real. You’re my elephant.”The elephant lifted her up and put her on his back, and she rode down the street. She waved to her neighbours. “Hello, Mr Green! Hello, Mrs Green!” “Look at Lindi!” said Mr Green. “How did she get up there? Maybe she grew!” “Don’t be silly,” said Mrs Green. “Little girls don’t grow that high. Everybody knows that.”The elephant took Lindi to the lake, and she slid down his trunk like it was a slide. “Wheeeee!” she shrieked. They played all afternoon, laughing and splashing and spraying each other with water.That night, the elephant tucked her into bed. “Good night, Elephant,” said Lindi. “Thank you for a lovely day.” He patted her head, and curled up to sleep outside her window.“Elephants are the best friends in the world,” Lindi said to herself. “Nobody knows that, except for me and my elephant.”	./Story text files/417.txt	2198	17	6.274678111587983	169	64	85	29.971830985915492	59	12	18	6.140845070422535	57	14	132	101	5	1.3710247349823321	246	37

“Meenu, please get a glass of water for Manoj,” says Amma. Manoj Mama has come to take me to Ooty! “We will go by train, Meenu. It is cold in Ooty even during summer, as it is in the hills,” he says.Summer is the season between spring and monsoon. It is called Greeshma Ritu in Sanskrit. School has closed for the summer. My friends and I do not mind playing outside. But our parents do not like us to play in the hot sun. So we sit under the trees and eat fruits and tell stories.Yesterday was new year’s day for my family. We call it Varsha Porappu in Tamil. Why are there so many new year’s days in the same year? Grandma made raw mango panna. So sweet and tangy! Jasmit’s mother made lassi. So cool and creamy! Last month, Farhan’s aunty made falooda for their new year. So milky and sweetsmelling!Appa has gone to Delhi. He says it is very hot and dusty there. In earlier times, people put mats made of khus on windows and kept them wet to cool their homes. Appa wears dark glasses to shade his eyes.He told us that he had to drink lots of nimbu pani to replace the water in his body because you sweat a lot in the heat of Delhi. He says he will bring lovely Dussehri mangoes for us from Delhi. The summer brings heat and dust but it also brings mangoes!Do you remember the little sapling I planted in spring? It is my friend. It is growing up. It has seventeen leaves now. I water the little tree twice every day in summer.I think it is waiting for the rain. Will it bear a fruit for me next summer?	./Story text files/353.txt	1505	18	5.403726708074534	147	14	128	43.294117647058826	22	12	29	9.558823529411764	17	17	106	55	3	1.3085106382978724	178	10

Sringeri Srinivas was a good farmer. He grew the best bananas, which made the best banana halwa.But he also had the scariest frown in the world. When he was angry, his forehead became full of deep lines. His nose became red. His eyes became very sharp.When Sringeri Srinivas frowned, everyone ran away from him. His wife, his children and his friends tried to hide. His cows and his dogs ran away. Even the crows in the field flew away when Sringeri Srinivas frowned.And Sringeri Srinivas frowned often. When his crops were not growing well. When his barber had no time to cut his hair. When the TV did not work. And so on. And on.One day, Sringeri Srinivas went into his field to look at his banana harvest. He was in a bad mood. No one knew why.He walked quickly to his biggest banana plant. There were big bunches of lovely fruit. Soon, he would begin to make his famous banana halwa. His frown changed to a small smile.Just then, a troop of monkeys came swinging from a tree nearby. The biggest one, with a fiery red bottom, jumped exactly onto the plant that Sringeri Srinivas was looking at proudly.This made him frown again. His frown grew and grew. It was his biggest frown ever. It began from his head and spread right to his toes.The monkey, with his own nasty temper, was surprised. He had never seen a frown like that. He dropped a halfpeeled banana on the ground, then he dropped a few more. Quickly, he jumped to the next plant and then the next. Soon, he was far away and safe from the frown.Sringeri Srinivas saw the monkey leap from plant to plant. He chased the monkey. He wanted to teach the monkey a lesson.On the way, he slipped on a banana peel. Swoosh, he went down, and his chappals got stuck in the mud.Sringeri Srinivas sat up and tried to chase the monkey again. Swoosh! He slipped again. This time, he fell with his face down.Somehow, he managed to sit up again, his mouth full of leaves and mud and twigs. When he looked up, the monkeys had gone.Sringeri Srinivas looked down at himself. His nice shirt was brown. His hands were dirty and scratched. He could not even find his own legs. They were all mixed up in the soil.Suddenly, he realised that he looked very funny. Sringeri Srinivas, the famous farmer. He was now sitting all by himself on a pile of leaves, mud and bananas. It was all very funny. And Sringeri Srinivas began to laugh. It was a little laugh at first. Hee Hee. Then it became bigger. Ha Ha!The more he laughed, the more Sringeri Srinivas wanted to laugh. The laugh grew bigger. HA HA HA. And bigger! Soon, he was clutching his stomach, and rolling on the mud. HA HA HA HAAAA! Tears were rolling out of his eyes.The laugh was so musical that the birds nearby came to listen. The laugh was so loud that the monkeys came back. The laugh was so funny that many kids came along. The laugh was so new that his whole family came out to hear it, too.Sringeri Srinivas laughed so much that everyone else began to laugh as well. The birds twittered. The crows cawed. The monkeys chattered. The kids began to giggle. The banana plants began to sway. The barber in the shop grinned. The tailor began to chortle. Even the tiger sleeping far away in his cave smiled into his whiskers.Suddenly, Sringeri Srinivas finished laughing. Everything and everyone around him looked so happy. He felt happy too. “Come on, let’s go home,” he said, holding his hands out to his children. Sringeri Srinivas still frowns sometimes. But now, he also likes to laugh. And he has the biggest laugh in town.	./Story text files/307.txt	3525	18	5.835164835164835	292	72	118	39.52873563218391	61	26	21	8.35632183908046	48	39	241	123	4	1.4121779859484778	368	59

YAWN! Kottavi Raja was sleepy. His ministers were talking about a complex problem and he was bored. He hadn’t slept well last night, or the night before. Or the thirty nights before that. He tried to concentrate on what they were saying. But the sentences were so garbled!“Insofar as the lessee is concerned, the right glablaglablaaa to till and tax blblblublooo loooballaooozzzzzzzzzzzz.” His head lolled forward. Raja Nalan was a good king. But of late, he had a problem staying awake during the day. He yawned in court all the time. So people had started calling him Kottavi Raja, because ‘kottavi’ means ‘yawn’ in Tamil.“Sujata,” he asked his queen one night, gently waking her up, “how come you are so alert and energetic throughout the day?” “Because I sleep at night,” she snapped. “And so should you.” Yes, sleep at night. But how? He was always sleepy during the day, sleepiest in the evening. But by night, he was alert, not at all sleepy! The next morning, in court, Kottavi Raja asked, “Prime Minister, what do you do when you aren’t sleepy at night?” “I ask Nidra Devi, the goddess of sleep, to bless me,” he said. “How?” “My mother used to say the goddess cannot resist a full stomach. So I ask my cook to serve a rich dinner, full of warm, sweet things. Two minutes after eating it, I’m fast asleep.” Kottavi Raja saw the minister’s round stomach. And believed him.The Finance Minister did not want to be left out. So he said, “I drink warm milk with honey at night. Simple, no fuss. No need to trouble the cook. And I always sleep a full nine hours.” The court musician did not like all these stories of food. When his stomach was full, he couldn’t sing. But he wanted to help. So he said, “In our family, my lord, we always invite Nidra Devi with music. A beautiful Neelambari, sung with the veena… Ah, bliss!”The poet said, “A gentle stroll in the palace gardens with a soft breeze blowing and the moonlight falling on parijatham f lowers. . . . ah! The beauty and poetry of the moment will wash away all your worries, Maharaja. Nidra Devi loves a peaceful mind.” The court jester added, “If nothing else works, my lord, a good story will always get you to sleep.”‘So many things to try, ’ thought Kottavi Raja. ‘One of them has to work. ’ That evening, the royal cooks were asked to prepare a special meal.Warm rice with ghee, hot sambar, fried potatoes, yam and khus khus payasam. And, to wash it all down, cool buttermilk. The king wanted to be sure that he would sleep at night, so he took two helpings of every dish. It was nearly  pm when he finished. Yet – old habits are hard to break – he wasn’t sleepy.He tossed and he turned and he became very unhappy with his Prime Minister. Nidra Devi was missing! He decided he simply hadn’t eaten enough. “Cook!” he bellowed. A sleepy cook hurriedly dressed and ran to the king. “Get me a large glass of warm milk with honey! Hurry!”Kottavi Raja gulped it down. Ouch! He was soooo full. He couldn’t get up, he couldn’t move and he definitely couldn’t lie down and fall asleep. ‘Perhaps I should try music, ’ he thought. He sent for the court musicians. They came, turbans askew, with hurriedly tied dhotis. It was past midnight.“Play Neelambari for me!” he said. It was wonderful to listen to the melody in the still night. Kottavi Raja relaxed. What bliss! Twenty minutes later, his eyelids began to droop. . . Then – TWANG! THUD! The veena player had fallen asleep on his instrument. .They began again. But one after the other, the sleepy musicians dropped notes and played the wrong tune. It was cacophony. Nidra Devi heard those tunes and bolted! And the king was wide awake and very annoyed. He remembered his jester’s idea and summoned him. “Tell me a story!” he said.The jester started a long boring story, hoping that the king would fall asleep. Ah, but our Kottavi Raja was not pleased. He got impatient and kept saying, “Yes, yes, but how does the story end?” Nidra Devi didn’t like the impatience. So she kept away. One hour later, a hoarse jester ended the story and went home blearyeyed. And the king? He was still awake. He woke the queen up and insisted on taking a stroll. She got ready grumpily.“Just up to the jasmine garden, okay? After that I’ll come back and sleep!” They walked in the moonshine, heard the drowsy tittering of birds and went around the large palace garden. The king found himself calming down and thought, ‘Aha! Now is the time to go back and sleep. ’ As he settled down, there was a dreamy silence all around. Until he heard a curious rumbling. From his stomach. The music, the story, the breeze, and the walk had made him hungry!The queen took matters into her hands. She ordered a small glass of milk, and got a masseuse to press his legs. In a few minutes, Nidra Devi came and blessed the king. The palace finally shut down for the night.Every day, this routine continued. Over time, Kottavi Raja started to sleep earlier. In two weeks, he found that he fell asleep after his second glass of milk. A few weeks after that, he started sleeping just after his walk. A month later, the jester’s story put him to sleep. And finally, he managed to sleep right after dinner. Most mornings, he woke up feeling fresh! He walked with a bounce in his step and smiled at everyone.But what about the cooks, the musicians, the jester, the masseuse, the queen? They remained on standby through the night – they never knew when the king might wake and ask for them. And they were sleepy, tired and grumpy all day. So were the people who waited for them  the cook’s wife, the musician’s son, the jester’s brother, the masseuse’s father, the queen’s maid, the maid’s husband, the husband’s brother, the brother’s friend, the friend’s parents. . . the whole city. The king grew worried about his sleepless people. He couldn’t recommend his elaborate remedy to everyone. So he asked his chief priest for a solution. The wise man knew that this was a tough problem. He said, “Get everyone to assemble in the town hall fifteen days from now. They should have a warm bath, finish dinner and arrive at sunset. I will summon Nidra Devi to bless everyone.”So the entire city gathered. They were all relieved that their sleepless nights were going to end. The priest began to chant hymns in praise of the goddess.A few minutes into his droning, a new mother, the sleepiest of them all, yawned. Looking at her, her infant yawned. The baby’s father saw this and. . . yes, yawned. A musician yawned halfway through a tune, and twenty people around him yawned. Then, their neighbours yawned and a mighty wave of yawns swept through the gathering.Nidra Devi couldn’t resist the power of so many yawns. She came running to the city, and touched everyone with a cooling breeze. And from that night onwards, she continued to bless everyone in Kottavi Raja’s land, every night.	./Story text files/250.txt	6850	26	5.840055632823366	591	128	226	44.67333333333333	92	58	37	9.173333333333334	69	81	420	299	5	1.3934040047114251	758	91

They say yes, I say no. They run up to meet me, and I run from the sea.They say no, I say yes. I run back to the edge. I chase the waves home to the sea.They say yes, I say no. They say no, I say yes. The sea chases me, and I chase the sea.There is blue. There is sea spray. In the game, I can’t be still.A chasing wave brings me a shell.

"“Puchku! Have a bath!” “Puchku! Eat your food!”“Puchku! Go to class!” ""Puchku! Get on the bus!” “Puchku! Do your homework!”“Where is Puchku?”Puchku is busy. She has a book to read. Puchku reads all the time — at home, in school, in the park, in bed. Page after page, book after book, one by one, she has read them all.""Why are you always reading Puchku? "" asks Boltu. ""Come, watch a cartoon instead! "" says Dodla.""Books are so much more fun!” says Puchku. “Look! You see a circle? And this straight line? Push it in, pull that out, and it becomes a letter. Line up the letters, and you have a word! Words can be wise, words can be funny, words can be sad and words can be sunny. When you put words together, they make sentences. And sentences become stories. Read it and WHOOSH! You are in another world! ”But today, Puchku is in a fix. She has run out of books to read! All the books that she could reach in the library, she’s read from Chapter One to The End.""What will I do? No more books to read! "" wails Puchku.Wait! What’s that over there? Puchku looks up and sees not one, not two, but three more shelves, FULL of books. “More books!” Puchku whispers in delight.There is still one problem though. She is too short. And the bookshelf is too tall. How can Puchku get up there?Maybe she can use a washing line? Or Ma’s sari to climb? How about the chairs and tables in the room?It would really be helpful, thinks Puchku, to have a giraffe at hand. Even a monkey. Or both!Puchku has a plan. She calls Boltu and Dodla for help. As quiet as they can, they climb on top of each other. “Boltu, you’re heavy!” Dodla complains. “Told you not to eat that last rasgulla.” “It’s not me,” Boltu hisses. “It’s Puchku!” “Shh! Almost there,” says Puchku. Just then, it all goes wrong.AHHHHHHHH!“What is happening here?” It is the Very Tall Librarian! She puts Puchku down. Boltu and Dodla run away! Puchku looks up sadly at the book she almost had in her hand. “Can I help?” asks the Very Tall Librarian.“I was trying to climb the bookshelf. I have run out of books to read,” says Puchku, sadly. “Why didn’t you say so?” says the Very Tall Librarian. “As long as I am around, you do not have to climb a bookshelf. May I pick you up?” Puchku nods.“I will take this, and this, and this one too!” says Puchku happily. “Thank you!” “Take this one too,” says the Very Tall Librarian. “When I was small, I loved this book.”“You were small once?” Puchku asks. “Oh yes, even smaller than you,” says the Very Tall Librarian. “But then I grew, and so will you. Until then, all you need to do is ask for a book and I will be here to give it to you.”But is Puchku listening? No she is not! She is inside her book, through a circle and a line And a letter and another. Then a word! And another, A sentence. And another. And now a story.Because Puchku has a new book."	./Story text files/245.txt	2843	21	5.709342560553633	242	47	90	28.31958762886598	82	15	23	6.505154639175258	74	23	157	132	3	1.169398907103825	347	19
"Moru had strong likes and dislikes. When he liked something, he loved it. And when he did not like something, he absolutely hated it. No one could make him do things that he did not want to do and no one could stop him from doing what he wanted to do.Moru liked to climb trees and steal raw mangoes. He would creep along the branch pretending to be a cheetah in a deep dark jungle. He enjoyed catching insects  the blue green bottle fly with the big shiny head, the thin and crisp grasshopper, and the yellow butterfly whose colour came off like powder on his fingers. Moru loved flying kites, the higher the better. He would climb to the tallest terrace to get his kite to soar far above the clouds like a brilliant eagle trying to reach the sun.Moru liked numbers. Number  looked thin and lonely;  was fat and wealthy. How graceful  was, even more so when she stood next to  and became . Numbers were like an unending staircase. Moru imagined climbing them one by one by one, racing up, sometimes two, sometimes three or four or more steps at a time.When he was tired, he saw himself sliding down the banister with the numbers waving at him. Unlike rice at lunchtime, which often finished before anyone was even half full, unlike friends who had to go home just as soon as the game was starting to be fun, numbers were always there. Unending and infinitely fun, to be juggled, sorted, matched, shared, laid out in a row, thrown away, put together and taken apart.Moru liked going to school because many of his friends went too. He liked getting up in the morning and having somewhere to go. He liked the big playground but he did not like going to class. He did not like the teacher. He felt trapped in the room. The children could not ask questions, they could not move around and they could not speak when they wanted to say things. The teacher was badtempered. Moru felt that the teacher did not like the children at all. Maybe he did not even like being a teacher or coming to a school. In any case, children did not like the teacher either.Every morning, the teacher wrote things on the blackboard. In a loud voice, he told the children to copy it down on their slates. Then he would go outside. If the boys could copy his things from the blackboard nicely, the teacher looked at it. If they could not do it, the teacher got angry. When he was angry, he would call the children names and if he got very angry he would hit them hard.One day, the teacher wrote some sums on the board. The sums were easy but they were boring. Moru did not feel like doing them and he did not have a slate. His slate had broken and his mother did not have the money to buy a new one. Instead he counted the hundreds of ants that were climbing the wall. He looked at the tree outside and noticed that the leaves were perfect. Perfect leaves had perfect shadows. In his mind, Moru counted how many broken bricks there were along the school’s compound wall. He calculated that if each brick costed five rupees it would take more than one thousand rupees to fill in all the gaps and broken spaces in the wall.“Moru!” scolded the teacher. “Why are you not doing anything?” Moru looked blank. “Where is your slate? Why haven’t you brought one to school?” shouted the teacher. Moru could see that the teacher was angry with him. Moru replied, “My old slate broke and I don’t have the money to buy a new one.” The teacher was angry and gave Moru a sharp tap with the stick in his hand.Moru continued softly, ""Even if I had a slate I won't do the sums because I don't want to. "" The teacher was furious. He slapped Moru. Moru's cheek burned bright red. Sudden hot tears sprang into his eyes. He stood up and ran out of the room, down the verandah, across the dusty playground, through the broken gate and away.The next morning, Moru's mother woke him up in time for school. But Moru would not get up. He lay on the narrow bed with his eyes tightly shut. Next day it was the same story, and the next day and the next. No one could persuade Moru to go back to school. One week passed and then one month. Moru sat on the wall in front of his house.Sometimes he would disappear into the market for hours. He would try to fly his kite from the terrace but it was no fun because the sky was empty. His mother scolded him, his brother teased him, his grandmother begged him, his uncle bribed him and his friends coaxed him. But nobody could persuade him to return to school.The rains came and school opened after the summer vacation. Everyone thought Moru would go back to school with all the children. “No,” said Moru very firmly. A year passed. Everyone gave up on Moru. Perhaps Moru gave up on himself too. Instead, he began to do other things.He would go to the market and give the vegetable sellers a hard time. He would gang up with other children like him who had left school and tease and taunt the children who were going to school. He would make paper airplanes out of the school notebooks of his friends. He would go up on the terrace and hit unsuspecting people who were passing by with pellets from his sling.One day, the old teacher left. A new young teacher came in his place. That day Moru was sitting on the wall watching the children go to school. No one asked him anymore why he did not go with them. Instead, children avoided him because they were afraid that he would bother them.The teacher was passing by. Moru looked at the teacher. The teacher looked at Moru Neither smiled and neither frowned. The next day, at the same time and the same place, Moru looked down from the wall. The teacher looked up at him and smiled. It was a small smile. Moru jumped from the wall and ran away.A few days later, the teacher was passing by. He was carrying a huge bag. The bag was very heavy. The teacher was having a difficult time. Moru scratched his head. The teacher passed him by slowly. Moru thought and then he ran behind the teacher. Without saying anything, he took hold of one end of the bag. The teacher was relieved and together they were able to get the heavy load to the school quickly.Inside the school , the bag was carefully put on the teacher’s table. The teacher opened the bag and let Moru look inside. There were many many books, colourful books of all sizes and shapes. They felt shiny and smelt new. “Can you help me to take them out?” asked the teacher.Moru began bringing out the books. There were books with stories in them, with pictures on the cover. Some were written in large letters. Some books had so much in them that the words had to be squeezed into the pages. Moru felt his excitement rising. He had not touched a book in two years.The next day, Moru waited till school was over and all the children had left. The teacher was alone. Moru went in quietly and stood by the door. The school seemed ghostly when all the noise and laughter and shouting was gone. The teacher looked up and said, “Good you have come. I need your help.” Moru was curious. What kind of help could the teacher need? He had many, many children in his school to help him. In a very matter of fact kind of voice the teacher said, “Can you help me sort out the books?”Moru sat on the floor. The books were all around him. There were so many storybooks. He put the animal ones together. The leopard storybook would feel more comfortable with the elephants and camels. The fairytales could sit with the stories about gods and goddesses. The adventure stories sat on their own. Or maybe they should go with the heroes and famous people?Then came the books with numbers. Moru's eyes and fingers slowed down. The fat numbers danced with the thin ones. Two digits balanced one on top of the other like an unsteady building still waiting for the base to be filled. The multiplication sums looked short and squat and got fatter and fatter at the bottom as the numbers got bigger. Division was just the opposite. You began with a lot and then if you were careful, you worked it down to create a long thin graceful tail. If you were lucky there would be nothing left. One by one all the numbers and their tricks came back to Moru.It was dark and the school had no lights. “You have to go home now, Moru, but you can come back tomorrow,” said the teacher. “But can you come when the children are here please?” Next day, soon after school started, Moru came. The children were surprised to see him and a little scared. By now Moru was famous as a ‘dada’ of the neighbourhood. “I have someone to help me now,” said the teacher. He put Moru with the younger children. There were books in which the children were supposed to write. “Please, can you help the children arrange these numbers in ascending and descending order?” The little kids scrambled around Moru; they were amazed that a tough fellow like Moru knew so much.Moru made the children stand in a line  the smallest children at one end and the tallest ones at the other end. He gave them numbers to hold. Now it was easy. Just like with short children and tall children, it is easy to know who to put where, it was the same with the numbers. Every day Moru would come for a little while and every day the teacher would give him a bigger and bigger task to do. Every day he found his love for numbers was getting stronger and every day his excitement and skill was being absorbed by the little children.One month later, Moru's mother was looking for him in the middle of the morning. He was nowhere to be found. She looked on the terrace but he was not there. She looked on the wall where he normally sat dangling his feet, but only his kites were resting there.She looked up on the mango tree, the leaves rustled in the breeze but there was no Moru on the branches. She went to the market but all the vegetable sellers were selling their vegetables without being bothered by the usual gang of boys. Finally, she walked down the lane and happened to look into the window of the school.There was Moru. His head was down, and he was looking carefully into his notebook. There was a frown of concentration on his forehead and a deep look of absorption in his eyes. He was busy solving complicated mathematics problems along with all the other children of his age. The teacher looked out too, and he smiled his soft warm smile at Moru's mother. She smiled back happily. Moru was in school again. This time he was learning more and more. And most importantly, this time he was loving it."	./Story text files/12.txt	10414	15	5.6988304093567255	837	189	190	58.85632183908046	83	91	36	12.132183908045977	60	114	719	307	5	1.4202401372212694	1071	95

Her chosen career is as a professional pilot, she has worked in a variety of aviation capacities from instruction to airline flying, and is the author of several aviation text books. Danielle started writing children's books as a creative outlet from the stress of her 'day job' and as a break from the sometimes monotonous work required for her professional writing. She began with the Mac and Dipper series, aimed at  year olds, inspired by two of her own dogs. After having children of her own, she suddenly found she had a muse, an eager resource for test reading, and, by benefit of age, an honest critic. It was fun and rewarding to write creative stories to match her children's learning curve. Danielle prefers to write for the 'learning to read' group, centred around a reading age of  to  years. Because of her passion for children's literature, and the role it plays in literacy standards, all of Danielle's books are available free in ebook versions. This also led Danielle to create the website 'Free Kids Books' to share free good quality childrens books with the community, in contribution to improved literacy standards world wide.

"Rima went to the fair with her uncle. It was a Boishakhi fair! So many colours everywhere. Red, white, and all the others. Uncle especially loved red.There were so many shops! And so many things to buy!Rima looked at everything in wonder.Suddenly… she didn't see her uncle. Where did Uncle go?He was nowhere to be seen! Rima was upset. But she did not lose courage.I know how to find lost things, Rima thought. I will explore the fair and look for Uncle!A crowd was gathered under a tree watching the snake act. Rima called out. But Uncle was not there.Maybe he is buying a doll for me! Rima thought. She ran to the doll shop. Rima called out. But Uncle was not there.Where did Uncle go?Perhaps he has gone to the red merrygoround, Rima thought. So she ran there.Rima called out. But Uncle was not there. Then Rima saw a man nearby. He was wearing a red panjabi like Uncle's!Rima called loudly, “UNCLE!”The man turned to look at Rima.“Oh, dear. Have you lost your Uncle?” he asked.Rima saw balloons flying above a tree. Near the tree she saw a boy. He was all alone and he was crying. “What happened? "" Rima asked. ""Why are you crying?” But the boy didn’t stop. “MAAAA! BABAAAA!” he cried.Rima knew just what to do. She took the boy to the closest microphone. ""This boy needs our help, "" she told the announcer. ""Please tell his parents he is right here! ""The boy’s parents arrived soon. They were so happy! But where was Rima’s Uncle? Wait… is that. . . “UNCLE!”They rushed towards each other. Uncle said, “Where have you been? I looked everywhere for you.” “I was looking for you! "" Rima answered.

That is a cradle hanging from the Neem tree. You know what is in there? Devi’s little sister!Yes, she is crying. You mean you can hear it as well? Devi certainly can. And she is sick of it!Devi has finally stopped playing hopscotch, and she has taken her sister out. Oops! The cradle is flying! Right over the tree! It’s only an old sari, what do you expect?That is Krishna, Devi’s friend. He thinks throwing small rocks at the sari will bring it down. The little girl in the orange skirt is Leela.She wants Devi to use a long stick to untangle the sari. All the kids are laughing at her. “If it was that easy, do you think WE wouldn’t have thought of it?” they ask.Salia is taking running jumps at the sari. She is quite tall, and her fingers just touch the cloth. Now ALL the children are lining up for jumps!Devi’s sister is quite happy. She is smiling and chewing on some grass she has found. Oh, no, she isn’t. Devi has taken it from her.Raju has organised all the children, big ones first, small ones later. Oh, gosh! Do you think he's going to make them climb on top of each other? Yes! and they are going to manage it!No, they are not! What now?That is Devi's father at the top of the road! Quick! Think of something! Leela is tottering under the long pole she has found. It's about to fall!No, it isn't. Krishna has taken it from her. Raju is helping too. This time they just might get it down!Quick! Put the baby in the cradle before Devi's father sees! In any case, it is nice to have friends to play hopscotch with.	./Story text files/57.txt	1527	12	5.653333333333333	128	22	76	32.21739130434783	35	11	15	7.260869565217392	28	18	87	63	4	1.1828571428571428	170	5

Wondering what to do with wordless stories? Wordless stories are wonderful because they contain infinite possibilities. Here are a few ideas for engaging with children using visual stories:  Explore the story in a leisurely manner. Draw attention to the details  the expressions of the characters, setting, colours, etc. The idea is for each child to build her own story. If the story is being shown to a group of children, you could ask each of them to contribute a sentence or two for each illustration. Take joy in exploring each illustration and build the story as you go along.  Use themes explored in the story to start a discussion. For instance, in this story, you could talk to children about our vast solar system or about insects, or simply ask them to think of what the fly was thinking in this story.  Encourage children to create  different stories using the same set of visuals. This will help push their imagination.	./Story text files/192.txt	932	14	6.654320987654321	48	33	173	76.75	3	9	34	14.666666666666666	3	9	43	38	5	1.6804123711340206	78	19

This story is about an uncle named Sandy, Who likes his camera so much, he always keeps it handy. Let's rewind to when Uncle Sandy was a little boy, Unlike his friends, he never dreamt of a fancy toy.Lost in books that spoke of magical creatures, Even in class, he never listened to his teachers. As time passed by, Uncle Sandy became a wildlife photographer, While his friends became doctors, engineers and dance choreographers.Uncle Sandy didn't want to work in big offices, He wanted to take pictures of snakes, crocodiles and tortoises. So he decided to leave his family and friends behind, And took off to the jungles with freedom in mind. On his first expedition to the Western Ghats, He had his first encounter with a mysterious cat. Uncle Sandy has been on its trail ever since, Hoping to click a picture of it, for evidence.So he decided to revisit the Western Ghats, Through its spiraling path in search of the cat. The cat in the ghat! The plan was to speak to animals along the way, To get clues about this cat whose colour he knew was grey.He began his journey at the foothills of the Ghats, With the summer sun so hot, Uncle Sandy needed a hat. “Let’s look for waterholes,” he said to himself, He knew that’s where the animals would tread.And guess who he got to meet, The top cat himself, Mr. Tiger to greet. “Oh mighty tiger,” he said, “would you have seen a cat? It is tall, swift and the colour of my hat.” The tiger didn’t have much to say, He roared and looked the other way.Phew! That was close, he thought, Just as he was drenched by giant rain drops. Along with the shower came a swarm of termites, Who were sadly eaten by ants, at first sight.Rains in the Western Ghats come down as waterfalls, Waterfalls become rivers and that's how there's water for all. So, if we need water to drink, Protecting the Western Ghats is the link.What Uncle Sandy saw next filled him with glee, A family of elephants bathing in a pond, yippee! They were making the most of the premonsoon showers, Some were kicking grass, others showing off their powers. “Excuse me you all,” said Uncle Sandy, waving his hat, “Would you have seen a big grey cat?”“No, no, no,” they all went in chorus, “We haven’t seen him around here, we promise.” Uncle Sandy found himself in the rainforest soon, “The second level of the Western Ghats,” he crooned. “Bark!” came a reply through the forest dense. “Oh that’s a Barking Deer I hear, it means no offence.”Up in the trees chomping through a jackfruit, He saw a lionfaced monkey, brute. A Liontailed Macaque is what it is, he knew, He’d looked through an encyclopedia of animals, woohoo! “Help me find a grey cat, will you?” said Uncle Sandy. “Okay,” said the feasting monkey.“Walk straight through the tall green trees Till you find one with a giant hive of bees.” “Under that tree lives a frog so rare It lives underground, hiding from the sun’s glare.” “He’s a clever frog I’m told, Knows the whole jungle inside out and twofold.” Uncle Sandy was so eager to look for the froggy He left without saying thank you to the monkey.Left, right, left, right, Uncle Sandy marched, Walking through a row of trees that were arched. Then he saw a tree very tall With a big beehive that was just about to fall.“Ribbit ribbit,” said a frog, But Uncle Sandy could not see it through the fog. “Oh you’re the man who comes in search of a cat, I heard about you from a clever little bat.” Said Uncle Sandy, “Please will you tell me where he is? I’ll give you an exotic flower, an Iris.”The frog was purple in colour, He’s the only one of his kind in India, Nasika batracus. The frog told him that he’d meet a tribesman, Who’d know where the cat lived, and would guide him. Uncle Sandy nodded, still in shock, He had just seen the most extraordinary frog.As he went further into the forests so thick, He saw that the trees were getting fewer very quick. “People cut trees,” he said, “to make products very cheap, And the poor animals, they have no place to sleep.” “These jungles are their homes you see, just like our houses back in the city.” Sad and disheartened by the state of affairs, Uncle Sandy decided to say a silent prayer.“Protect these forests, oh dear God, please, Save them so the animals can live in peace.” Saying so he carried on, the high altitude grasslands waiting, And that’s where he’d find the cat from its hiding.The remotest of places in the whole of the Western Ghats, The grasslands so green, Uncle Sandy just sat. Staring at the miracle of creation and the beauty of this place, This, he felt, was really his land of fairy tales. Pat came a tap on his back, He turned to see a face painted black.“Who are you, Sir?” Uncle Sandy questioned “I am a tribesman who lives here unquestioned.” “Oh but sir, will you be as kind To answer one question I have on my mind? “Where can I find the special cat I’m looking for? I’ve seen it only once before.”“Are you talking about Pogeyan?” he said. Uncle Sandy wasn’t sure what he meant. “The cat that comes and goes as the mist, Are you referring to that elusive cat that exists?” “Yes Sir, that’s the one,” Uncle Sandy affirmed. He was so happy he could’ve drummed and hummed. “Aha!” said the tribesman, pointing to the mountains higher up, “I’ve seen the cat over there, all of three times in closeup.”Uncle Sandy was feeling extremely blessed. He did a somersault that left the tribesman perplexed. Uncle Sandy was whistling to himself, and climbing When he saw two male Nilgiri Tahrs headbutting. Looking at how well they'd adapted to the terrain, Uncle Sandy wished he too was born on the mountains.Sure he’d find his cat somewhere around here, Uncle Sandy decided to put camera traps all over. Then he slept a good night’s sleep Under an open twinkling sky, on a hillock steep. When he woke up, he ran to his camera traps and checked. Yes, yes, yes, there were images of his cat! ! The cat in the ghat!The cat looked the same as it did ten years ago, Uncle Sandy was happy, ho, ho, ho! That’s when he felt a tiny snake crawling over his feet. He was startled, and realised he’d been dreaming in his sleep. Uncle Sandy prayed his dream would come trueHope he finds his grey cat soon, don’t you?The Cat in the Ghat is a whimsical tale of Uncle Sandy going in search of a mysterious cat in the Western Ghats. It has been inspired by the reallife expedition by Sandesh Kadur, a National Geographic Emerging Explorer, wildlife filmmaker and conservation photographer. His goal is to inspire people to protect and appreciate what remains of our wilderness. He is still looking for the Pogeyan!	./Story text files/324.txt	6583	20	5.833819241982507	562	124	156	72.15555555555555	24	66	23	14.233333333333333	18	72	392	294	5	1.458498023715415	679	80
In a small garden in the city, there was a big pipal tree. Many small animals lived together on the pipal tree. There also lived a family of squirrels. Vikki was one little squirrel among them who liked to talk big. His cousin, Kato from Far Forest, had come to visit him.One evening, as all the animals who lived in the little garden were just going to sleep, they heard loud sounds from the park, next to the little garden.Kato and the other squirrels saw big yellow machines, and men in hard yellow hats, pointing to the little garden and other houses on the street. They were going to pull them all down and build a parking lot.The people who lived there would move to other houses; but no one gave a thought to the animals, birds and insects who lived in the little garden.The machines were first spotted by the mole family. To be more exact, by Mister Popples, the eldest who told Master Mopples, who in turn told the youngest, Little Popples.When they were young they were called Pop, Mop and Pip.Mister Popples told the squirrels, the squirrels told the birds, caterpillars, butterflies, tiny spiders and all those who lived in the little garden. There was total panic, a lot of running, flying, scurrying and hopping, with no one knowing what to do? Where to go?The caterpillars said, “Let us look for leaves.” The butterflies said, “We want flowers.” The mice wanted holes. The moles wanted to dig their own holes. The squirrels, birds, insects wanted trees, bushes and grass. All the animals wanted the soft earth, not cement or concrete. “Where will we find all this?” they cried. “We will surely die,” they said and wept.Kato’s uncle and aunt were very quiet and all the little squirrels crept close to their mom. Kato cleared his throat and spoke shyly, “I live in the Far Forest, may be we can all go there?”There was a buzz of excitement and someone said, “How?” Kato scratched his head and thought hard, “Well, the Squirrel Express can take the squirrels and the butterflies, spiders, caterpillar and all the insects. The birds can either fly or come with us. The moles, mice and the grass snake family can go by the underground Mole Express.”Everyone thought it was a splendid idea. Mister Popples rushed to ask Mister Grumbles, the driver of the underground express train if he could take them all to the Far Forest. Mister Grumbles fumbled, stumbled, bumbled before he finally mumbled, “Alright.” Now it was Mister Popples’ turn to be grand. “Friends, you need not worry, my grandfather’s grandson’s. . . third nephew’s . . . . . second niece’s family live in the Far Forest.”So, in the early hours of the morning the Squirrel Express and the Mole underground train with all its passengers, chugged their way to the Far Forest with its trees, flowers, ponds and soft earth.	./Story text files/296.txt	2793	17	5.975438596491228	225	60	197	61.08888888888889	21	24	35	11.866666666666667	16	29	175	110	4	1.4454828660436136	294	27

"Shree lives in an apartment in a small town called Katpadi Junction. Amma works in a jewellery shop. Appa works as a taxi driver. They want her to learn computers. So they are pleased that she likes to use it. The computer is Shree’s friend. She always finds time for it. She uses it to find information for school projects and send emails.Shree’s aunt also stays with them. Everyone calls her Akka. Most of the time, she naps in front of the TV that shows her favourite old films. She gives Shree hot dosas stuffed with spicy noodles. After tiffin, Shree likes to play. Not the traditional games that Akka likes to play, with stones and shells. Shree likes to play games on the computer.The computer doesn’t just have games. It also has FriendsNet. Shree joined it two months ago, on her thirteenth birthday. After snacks and tea, she chats with her school friends through FriendsNet. They tell each other what they did since they met last, on the school bus. Shree says that she got extra sugar with her tea. One friend says, “That you get every day.” Shree says, “And I also got muttonflavoured noodles with my dosa.” Another friend teases, “Do you do anything other than eating?”You have a friend request from Chaitra Shree gets angry. She decides to unfriend them. Afterwards, she misses them. But before she can tell them she’s sorry, she gets a new friend request. It is from a girl called Chaitra. She is very pretty, like a film star. ACCEPT REFUSEShree clicks ACCEPT. One click, and they become friends. Chaitra types, “Do you have many friends?” “No! And I lost a few friends today.” She adds a sadface emoticon. “So what? It really doesn’t matter how many friends you have—it is the nature of our friendship that matters. And you have me now!” Shree likes the sound of that.“Where do you go to school?” types Shree. “Near your school,” types Chaitra. “How do you know which school I go to?” wonders Shree. “Because it is near my school.” “That’s nice. Then we can meet,” types Shree. Chaitra signs off. “Yes! And we’ll be best friends forever. Bye!”The next morning, Shree looks for a school near hers. But she cannot see one. It is a little strange that she hasn’t heard of any other school nearby. But Chaitra is nicer than all her other friends. She is Shree’s special friend and nobody else’s friend.Today she doesn’t touch the hot noodles, though they are her favourite flavour–chilli chicken. Akka wonders what is wrong. “Are you feeling unwell?” “Too much school work,” lies Shree. “Then go and finish your homework, while I take my nap,” says her aunt. But Shree doesn’t do her homework. Instead, she starts the computer, goes online and waits for her new friend to ping her. Soon she gets a message from Chaitra.“Hello, friend. How are you today?” “I’m fine, I didn’t eat my tiffin,” types Shree. “Why?” types Chaitra.“Because I wanted to talk to you. So I finished tea quickly,” types Shree. “Great. Now can you send me a selfie? And give me your number so I can call you,” types Chaitra. “I don’t have a camera phone,” types Shree and feels sad.Chaitra offers to give Shree her old camera phone. “Let us meet on Sunday. Then I will take your snap. And give you my old phone.” Shree has always wished for a phone with a camera. She types, “Where shall we meet?” Chaitra types, “Come to the railway station.” Shree asks, “What time?” Chaitra decides, “When the Bengaluru train reaches there.”Akka comes into the room just then to clean it. “What are you doing, Shree?” “I have a new friend, Akka!” Akka looks over Shree's shoulder at Chaitra’s profile picture. “But that’s the film actress I like so much, Madhoo. She’s your friend?” “Yes, but her name is Chaitra.”Akka laughs and shakes her head. “That’s Madhoo, I’ve seen all her films. She must be so old now.” “She’s the same age as me!” insists Shree. “No, no, she’s as old as I am,” says Akka. “That snap was taken when she was still in school. It is from her first movie.” Shree is angry with Akka, then stops to think. Is Chaitra using someone else’s picture— a film star’s?“How old are you?” she types. “I told you I’m thirteen, the same age as you,” Chaitra types back. Shree replies, “That is good. Best friends should be the same age.” “Hey, the earrings in your profile picture are so pretty!” types Shree. “Thanks, I made them myself.” “Wow. Wear them when we meet tomorrow!” “Okay, but only if you come alone,” says Chaitra. “Why?” types Shree. “Because I am coming alone too! To our secret meeting!”Shree is typing ‘Okay’ when she remembers something. “Hey Chaitra, I haven’t seen any other school near our school.” But Chaitra has gone offline. Is there something strange about her new friend? Has she been lying?Shree is very confused and cannot focus on her homework. “Akka?” she asks. “Yes, my dear,” says Akka, “what is worrying you?” Shree decides to be honest and tells her all about her new friend who is lying. “Akka, what should I do?”The next day, Shree and Akka reach Katpadi Junction much before the arrival of the Bengaluru Express. They have a secret plan to find out if the new friend is honest or not. Akka says, “I will go and talk to the station manager so he can help us.”The train from Bengaluru is coming in. Shree looks all around. She can’t remember whether Chaitra had asked her to wait inside the station or outside. Where did Akka go? She can’t see her anywhere.Many passengers come out of the train. None look like Chaitra. A man who's her father's age walks towards Shree. He is smiling. ""Hello Shree! "" Shree is shocked. She doesn’t know him. “It is so nice to see you!” he says. “Who. . . who are you—you are not Cha…Chaitra!” stutters Shree.“No. But I am an uncle and would like to be your friend, Shree. I like to make friends with young girls,” says the unclewhoisnotChaitra. “Eeeeeeee!” shrieks Shree. Akka is beside her in a second, along with the station manager. The unclewhoisnotChaitra is surprised. He didn’t expect that Shree would bring two grownups with her.Akka hits him with her handbag. Then she yells, “Don’t you dare come near my niece!” “Owww!” he cries. Just then the train moves. He runs towards a bogey door. The station manager rushes forward to catch the man. But he disappears into the crowded train. They all go to the police station.“You are a brave pair!” says a policewoman. “Thank you for informing us about this imposter. Shree, you were clever to confide in a trusted adult! Will you put up this poster about cyber security in your school, please? We would also like to conduct a cyber safety class in your school.” She says an expert from the Cyber Crime Cell will need to take a look at Shree’s computer.The next day, a cyber crime officer goes through Shree’s computer. Within hours, the police find the man who pretended to be Chaitra. They nab him from his office in Bengaluru and find that he has been trying to befriend many young girls and boys on social media. Shree decides to only have friends from her own school. She can’t wait to tell her friends about her scary adventure with her cyber ‘friend’.Be safe online!

"Amma! There is a bat in my sambar! Eesh! I do not want her in there.I know you told me to shut the windows tight. But I forgot this one on the right!Phew! The bat has stopped swimming in my food. She seems to be in a very bad mood.She is flying in circles around my face, Flapping her wings, making my heart race.Watch out! Hide! Run for your life! She's dropping poop bombs. They are not very nice.""Suppi, relax"" Amma whispers, ""I think she wants to go back to her brothers and sisters. ""Amma turns off the fan and all the lights. I open the windows and don’t put up a fight.Amma is right! (Is she ever wrong? ) The bat takes off on her wings, webbed and long.I rush to the window and wave goodbye, As she swoops up a tree that touches the sky.It is back to the table for dinner now, Though I'm not sure we should eat that sambar somehow!What to do if a bat comes to visit you? Have you ever seen a bat flying about and felt scared? Did you think the bat was going to sleep in your hair for the night? Bats are not at all interested in hanging upside down from your hair. They would rather rest their feet in the branches of a tree or the roof of a cave or the wall of a building! If a bat comes into your house, don’t get frightened. Our winged friend may be just as scared as you are. Instead, turn off all the lights and fans, leave the windows wide open and wait patiently.

"Tara and Ravi are going to the market. Amma has given them a list of fruits and vegetables to buy. At the market, Tara spots juicy red tomatoes. ""I hope Amma makes tomato chutney today, "" she says.Monappa, the vegetable seller, weighs everything. Into the bag goes:   kg fresh red tomatoes  ½ kg onions  ½ kg potatoes   coconut   limes *Half is written as ½. It means one out of two equal parts of something. *A kilogram is written as kg.Tara and Ravi walk home singing: ""We want . . . Tomato chutney, tomato chutney. Amma's tasty tomato chutney! ""Suddenly Ravi asks Tara, ""Is something dripping on your feet too? "" Their bag is wet. Oh no! The tomatoes are all squashed at the bottom. Tara whispers to Ravi, ""Our tomato chutney looks so horrible. Not at all like Amma's! ""The next week, Tara and Ravi are careful. ""Heavy vegetables at the bottom; soft and light ones on top, "" Ravi keeps repeating. Into the bag goes:   watermelon  ½ kg potatoes   coconut  ½ kg grapes   raw bananas  ½ kg tomatoes, right on top.But at home, they find the grapes have become grape juice under the raw bananas! ""Last time we made the tomatoes into chutney. This time we made the grapes into juice. Wonder what we will do next! "" Tara says sadly.Next time, Amma's list also has oranges. They are soft and light. So they go on top, next to the tomatoes.Just as Tara and Ravi are walking home singing their chutney song, their friends see them. They are thirsty, so they eat up all the oranges!At home, Amma hugs them when she hears about the missing oranges. She tells them not to feel sad.Next week, Tara and Ravi are clever. They hide the oranges under the lightest thing  a bunch of pudina leaves. Now their thirsty friends will not spot the oranges!That night, Amma makes her tasty tomato chutney and lemon rice. Tara and Ravi gobble up their dinner. And what do they get later? Sweet, juicy oranges, of course!.

The twins Samar and Nivya are waiting for the school bus. “Do not turn around. He is staring at us!” Samar hisses at his sister Nivya.The Rakshas Sweetie Man is watching the children from his shop across the road. He is huge and scary! “His face is like a bulldog!” Samar says rudely. “His nose is like a samosa!” Nivya says. “And his fingers look like hairy bhindis!”The Rakshas SweetieMan may be scary, but he has the most fabulous sweet, toys and general shop – the Lovely Sweetie and Toy Shop.It has large piles of colourful sweets and chocolates. They see other children go into the shop but the twins are too scared to buy a single sweetie or toy from him.Once, they had seen heaps of a new chocolate in the shop. They decided to be brave, and went inside. “Pl…please, can we have that chocolate?” Samar mumbled.The Rakshas SweetieMan leaned across the counter, and reached out for them with his huge pythonlike arms. “Your teeth will fall out!” he grumbled softly.He took out a dreadful pair of false teeth from his cash drawer. He snapped it at the children. Samar and Nivya took one look and fled! “He was going to bite us with those teeth,” Nivya said trembling, once they were safely home. They never dared go back again.But today, Samar and Nivya see something even more scary. The Rakshas SweetieMan is holding a wriggling puppy close to his face and rumbling! Then he takes the puppy inside his shop and disappears. “Oh no! He is going to cook the puppy and eat her!” Nivya squeals.Samar and Nivya are sure that their own dog Lolo and her six new puppies are in danger. “We will not let the Rakshas SweetieMan cook you all,” says Nivya.But the next day, when Ma goes to the market, she leaves the gate open. Samar and Nivya watch in horror as all the six puppies run out – and straight into the Rakshas SweetieMan’s shop! “He is going to eat them too, now!” Samar cries. “We have to rescue them!”Samar and Nivya hold hands and slowly walk into the dark cave of the shop.

Dipa loved to jump. She loved to climb trees. And most of all, she loved to run and play with her Puja Didi.Dipa lived in Agartala, the capital of Tripura. Agartala is green and beautiful with agarwood trees and pineapple, orange and litchi orchards.Her Baba was a national weightlifting champion. On most days, she went with him to the gymnasium, where he was a coach.Ma and Baba wanted both their daughters to take up sports. So, at the age of five, Dipa started training.Gymnastics is a lot like acrobatics and aerobics. Quick movements. Tumbling and soaring. Fluid twists and turns.Breathtaking somersaults on narrow beams, vaults and uneven bars! Gymnastics needs balance, lots of mental effort, and control over muscles. One false step can mean a bad fall. Or a broken leg or an injured back!Dipa started training. But she was so scared of falling, that she wouldn’t even step onto the beams. She threw tantrums and complained a lot.Baba believed that she would get over her fear. He was right!Wheeeee! Dipa was cartwheeling. Whoooosh! She was sailing through the air. Baba and her coach Soma Nandi were so happy.When Dipa turned nine, she participated in the balancing beam event in the  Northeastern Games. And guess what? Dipa won the gold medal! What a golden moment for her. This win meant a lot to her and Baba. She was no longer a reluctant gymnast.Dipa still had to work hard. She was flatfooted, which means that the soles of her feet didn’t have the usual natural curve. Flat feet affect how a gymnast runs, and how she lands on her feet during jumps. But Dipa had come so far — she decided she would not give up.Her coach Soma Nandi introduced her to Guruji, Bishweswar Nandi, who took over her training. Soon, she was doing special exercises that helped her feet develop an arch.Gymnastics has never been popular in India. It did not matter to Dipa that she did not have the best infrastructure or space to train in.Guruji created equipment with scooter parts to serve as springboards. Crash mats were piled on top of one another to become her vaulting platform, and seats from old cars became her landing space.Dipa’s days were busy! Dipa ran. She jumped. Twisted and turned. She did rolls and stands on her head. For eight hours a day.Her bones ached and her muscles were painfully sore. She was moody, hungry and very tired.Like most children, Dipa loved ice cream. But she was put on a strict diet.She sometimes had to live and train in a sports hostel, far from home. And on top of all of that, she had exams! Did she mind working so hard? No, she did not! All Dipa wanted was to win medals. And become the best.The years went by and Dipa won all the junior and national titles she competed in. However, she didn’t win anything at the  Commonwealth Games. Ashish Kumar became the first Indian gymnast to win medals at that event — it was a proud moment for India. Dipa was inspired by this win. She was determined to do better.Four years later, Dipa won the bronze at the  Glasgow Commonwealth Games. And also at the  Hiroshima Asian Gymnastics Championship. It was so thrilling to stand on the winners’ podium!So far, Dipa had won  medals, and that included  gold ones! But Guruji wanted her to make a mark in the international arena — she had to perfect something that hadn’t been attempted by most gymnasts. Something bold. And dangerous.Guruji trained her to do the Produnova vault. It was named after the first woman who mastered it — Yelena Sergeyevna Produnova. Only four other women in the world had landed this extremely dangerous manoeuvre.In , Dipa was  and she was ready to show her skills to the world at the Rio Olympics. The country waited eagerly to see her win a medal. And she missed! She missed winning a medal by just .  point.But her performance left everyone awestruck.As Dipa began training for the next Olympics, she also had a new plan up her sleeve. She wanted to create a new gymnastic manoeuvre. When Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci met her, she said, “Good for India to have a role model in Dipa Karmakar… I hope kids look up to her and take up gymnastics because that is how we all started.”Dipa continues to make India proud. (Dipa with her coach Bishweswar Nandi)Dipa Karmakar was born on August , , in Agartala. She was the first Indian female gymnast to compete in the Olympics. Dipa participated in the  Olympic Games in Rio and is one of only five women to successfully land the dangerous Produnova vault. She was five when her father Dulal Karmakar, a national weightlifting champion, initiated her early training. Soma Nandi was Dipa’s first coach and then her training was taken over by Bishweswar Nandi, a national gymnastic champion. Dipa has been conferred the Khel Ratna award and is a Padma Shri recipient.	./Story text files/161.txt	4773	19	6.259740259740259	335	127	196	51.46153846153846	53	38	39	10.263736263736265	42	49	220	242	5	1.619485294117647	443	101
It was a beautiful summer day in the ForestByTheSea in the glorious land of Somewheristan. Whales danced in the waves, singing to each other. Sea lions, their smooth brown bodies glistening in the sun, played peekaboo with the noisy seagulls, barking and scolding. Every creature in the Forest was happy, happy, happy.Excuse me! you say. That can’t be true. There’s NEVER a time when EVERY creature ANYwhere is happy, happy, happy. Hmmm. Maybe you’re right. Maybe not EVERY creature was happy. This journalist bear, for instance. In this picture, Bear is trying to smile, but he has a great sorrow. He simply cannot find a ‘BREAKING NEWS’ story. He even sent Bird to look  because Bird moves faster and sees better  but Bird came back with nothing.‘BREAKING NEWS’ stories are about anger and fear and hate and greed, and there was none of that in the Forest. Everything was happy, happy, happy. A journalist bear without a ‘BREAKING NEWS’ story doesn’t deserve to be a journalist bear, thought Bear sadly to himself. He should be a Waiter Bear, or a Sweeper Bear, or a Telephone Voice Bear, saying, ‘Please check the number you have dialled’, or ‘Kindly wait  you are in a queue’.He packed his things and started walking to the busstop, when Singing Sardarji popped out from behind a tree.“Arrey oh Journalist Bear!” said Sardarji. “Going somewhere?” “Don’t call me that or I will cry,” said Bear, and told Sardarji he was leaving to become a Telephone Voice Bear. “Don’t be such a silly bear, Bear!” scolded Sardarji. He pulled out a guitar and began to sing. “If Tweety birds stop tweeting, and Hooty Owls stop hooting, the world would be a sad playyyyce, don’t you see?”“Don’t you seeeeeeee?” sang the Tweety Birds and the Hooty Owls. “If Singing Sardarjis don’t, and Journalist Bears won’t, the world would be a bad playyyyyce, don’t you see?” sang Sardarji.“I do enjoy being a Journalist Bear,” Bear said sadly. “I do love finding out things, and talking to people, and writing their stories, but I also do NOT have a ‘BREAKING NEWS’ story, which means. . .” ‘AHA! ’ said Singing Sardarji. “What?” said Bear, puzzled. “You like finding out things! And talking to people! And writing their stories! You are a Journalist Bear, Bear, but you have the soul of a. . . drumroll please. . . Writer Bear!”Bear beamed. Sardarji was right! He really WAS a Writer Bear. “Tell you what, Bear,” Sardarji went on, “let’s travel the world, you and I. I will sing, and you, Bear, will write. Not 'BREAKING NEWS' stories  no one remembers those after three days, anyway  but real stories of real people, stories that will never grow old.” “Hurray!” said Bear.And that was how Writer Bear and Singing Sardarji set out to explore the world. Everywhere they went, Sardarji sang to the people, and Bear listened to them. Over time, Bear wrote many, many stories. Happy stories that made people cry, funny stories that made them think, sad stories that made them hope, and scary stories that made them laugh. And Storyweavers all over the world picked up the long, strong, shining threads of Bear's stories, and wove them into new and wonderful stories for all of us to enjoy.	./Story text files/34.txt	3159	17	5.994100294985251	272	67	167	48.375	41	23	33	9.59375	37	27	179	160	5	1.3884711779448622	361	38
Once it started raining, it just wouldn’t stop. The sky wept great tears in an endless stream until the clouds had entered everyone’s hearts and made them feel as gray and weepy as the weather. But still, it rained on and on. Everyone stayed at home, gloomy and bored. “I wish we could DO something,” moaned Geeti, “Nothing exciting ever happens to us,” said Vikki.Mummy wouldn’t let them go out, but she tried to cheer them up by making hot, crisp pakodas for them. The children helped too, cutting the potatoes, onions, spinach and cauliflower. The pakodas were yummy. They ate them hot, dipping them into spicy green chutney. Soon the children were bursting full. So mummy put the leftover pakodas on a plate and covered them so that they could eat them the next day, with cold lassi and leftover rotis.The children now stood at the window, “I wonder what the animals and birds do?” asked Geeti thoughtfully. “They must be cooped up in their cages.”“No, silly, I mean the wild ones. The tigers in the jungles, the birds on trees, what do they do in all this rain?” “At least they’re free. Think of the animals in the zoo. How awful for them.”And it was true. The animals in the zoo were worried and irritable. The wetness was terrible for the creatures, big and small. The more it rained, the more everything filled up with water.The moat around the lion’s enclosure filled up with water too. The lion watched. He was an old fellow, who had never been out of the enclosure.He had never seen anything like this before. As the water lapped the sides of the moat temptingly, the old fellow decided to make a go for it. He sniffed here, and he sniffed there. He put one paw delicately into the water and then, with one big breath, he jumped right in.At first he sank. Then he panicked. He thought for one awful moment that he was going to die. But he didn’t. His mighty head popped up and he paddled along until he could feel the wall just under his chin. Putting his big paws onto the wall, he heaved himself up with a, ‘‘Dum laga kar, hoyee shah!”And then he was out. Out and free. Free to walk around the world, just as he had seen hundreds of people do. Now, he, the mighty raja, was going to have the adventure of a lifetime. No one saw him for it was night and all the zookeepers were fast asleep. Lion walked out, king of everything he saw. Softly, softly, he crept on padded feet to the enclosure next to him. He grinned at the bear who awoke with a start. He winked at him and laughed softly.He looked in at all the cages and thought how wonderful it was to be free. Then he had an idea. He was going to be really, truly free. What was the use of freedom if he was till within the four walls of the zoo? So, asking for the way at every cage he passed, Lion reached the main gate.He could smell a human. He carefully peered into the ticket booth. Lion was a clever old fellow and knew that the guard wouldn’t let him just walk out. So he waited and watched. The guard didn’t move. He snored gently. When Lion was sure that the man was fast asleep, he padded his way past him softly.“Hmmmhumph…” said the guard in his sleep. Lion almost roared in fright. But he didn’t. He waited quietly until he was sure that all was safe. And then he was FREE! Really free, for the very first time in his life. He walked around; looking with wonder at the big, black, wet roads. He stared up at the high buildings and he sniffed at the people huddled up, asleep in the driest corners they could find. One little child peeped out of his thin blanket and saw him.“Papa,” he whispered, “there’s a lion on the loose!” “Yes, yes,” said his Papa sleepily, “he’ll go away, now get back to sleep.”And Lion went on. This was the longest walk that he’d ever had. He was in the bazar now. But, of course, everyone was fast asleep. He peered into shop windows, fascinated by the glittering things that shone there.He walked on and on. On and on. Until he was one very wet, hungry and tired lion. He now suddenly caught the smell of yummy fried pakodas. He had never smelled anything so invitingly warm or warmly inviting. Sniff! Sniff! Sniff! He found the window to Geeti and Vikki’s room open. Quickly, quietly, he jumped right in. He saw the children asleep in their soft, warm beds. And he felt like getting in with them. But first to find out where that delicious smell was coming from. Sniff! Sniff! Sniff!Of course, with his sharp lion’s nose, he found the pakodas. And with his sharp lion's teeth, he quickly chomped them up. They were delicious. Not like the smelly raw meat he got. He loved the crispy pakodas. He licked the plate clean.And now, to bed. Slipping back into the children’s room, Lion tried to get into Vikki’s bed. But it was too small for one big lion. Then he tried snuggling into Geeti’s bed, but it was too small for one big lion. So, he crawled under the bed and found it wonderfully cozy and just right for one big lion. Soon he was fast asleep…Next morning, mummy woke up to find the pakodas missing. “Vikki, Geeti, did you eat all the pakodas last night?” “No mummy, not at all,” the children said. “It must have been you who ate them. Don’t lie to me, children. Who else could it be?” “Oh, it must have been the lion who ate them, mama!”“Lion, what lion? Geeti, don’t be silly.” “She’s not being silly,” said Vikki. “There’s a lion under our bed!” “What?” shouted mummy as loudly as she could. And she rushed right away to look for the lion under her children’s bed. She looked, but there was no lion there. “Oh children,” she said crossly, “you gave me a fright. Of course there’s no lion there.”“But there was, mummy,” protested the children. “Look, there are lion paw prints on the carpet.” “And a big wet patch on our beds.” “And lion hair on my sheet!”Mummy had to believe them then, but try as they might they couldn’t find the lion anywhere. And do you know why? Lion had had a good snooze and had decided to get back to his cage before there was any fuss.So he slipped away at dawn and no one saw him going. Except the same little boy in a blanket, who had seen him earlier. The little boy patted Lion’s nose and thought, ‘Grown ups never believe us children, so I’m not going to tell anyone that the lion was taking a walk tonight. ’The old lion slipped past the guard who still lay asleep and swam back into his cage. What an adventure it had been! But he was glad to be home. As soon as the rain stopped, Geeti and Vikki went to the zoo. They stood outside Lion’s enclosure and whispered to each other.I’m sure that our Lion recognized them too, for he let out a big, rumbling ROAR of thanks to his little friends.Maybe, next time it rains very hard, Lion may come to your house, so remember to have some freshly fried pakodas ready for him. This story is almost true. Once, in Jaipur, Rajasthan, it rained so hard that a zoo lion’s moat got flooded and the lion really did swim out of its enclosure. It walked all around the zoo and then got so wet that it went and sat in the ticket booth, from where it was caught and returned to its cage. That’s why I thought we should let the old lion take a really good, adventurous walk in the story.(Actually, some baby crocodiles also swam out of their enclosures, but that’s another story for another day. )	./Story text files/539.txt	7275	19	5.5782493368700266	638	116	157	50.97142857142857	77	63	31	10.7	62	78	446	308	5	1.3396004700352526	780	71
Droso was a newborn fruit fly. He opened his wings for the first time, and flapped them up and down very fast.  times in one second, to be exact! “WOW I’m flying!” he shouted.Droso looked down at the rotten banana on which he was born. What a view! His sister Phila was finding her wings too. “How high can I fly?” Droso wondered, and flew a little higher.Phila liked going up too, but not as much as she liked to pose. One leg here, two legs there, and the other three over there. She posed in different ways. “I want to be a model,” she announced.The next day, Droso flew to the top of the fruit basket. The day after that, he made it to the top of the refrigerator. Higher and higher Droso flew, until . . . he hit the ceiling. He couldn't fly any higher!You see, Droso and Phila were inside Richa's house. Richa was an astronaut. In two weeks, Richa would sit in a rocket and shoot up into space. She had been so busy planning her trip, that she hadn’t noticed her bananas rotting.Richa the astronaut was not so different from Droso the fruit fly. Like Droso, Richa also wanted to go to higher places. Flying to space had always been Richa’s dream. And it was about to come true. How exciting!All Richa thought about was space! Space begins a hundred kilometres or so above the Earth. It has no air to breathe and no ground to stand on. There is no up and no down! So in space, nothing falls down. Astronauts like Richa just float around. What a strange place!Richa often wondered, “How would birds fly in a place like space where there is no up and no down?” There was only one way to find out. “I’ll take a bird with me to space!” she decided.But which one? A pigeon, perhaps? No, it has too many feathers. A crow? Too big. A sparrow? Too noisy. Also, it eats too much.Richa thought long and hard until she got very hungry. She reached for the fruit basket. “Yuck, rotten fruits!” And that’s when she saw Droso and Phila buzzing around. “Fruit flies!” cried out Richa. “They are perfect for space!”She put Droso and Phila in a jar. She also put some rotten banana goop in the jar for them to eat. Then, she threw out the rotting banana peel and made herself a sandwich.Today is the day that Richa flies into space. Look at what is in her hand!Phila is the first ever space model. Astronauts take many photos of her eating and resting in space. And Droso? Richa and her scientist friends closely watch how he uses his wings in space.Look! Droso the fruit fly is finally going high, high, high. . . higher than any other fly in the world.Animals in Space Drosophila is the scientific name of the fruit fly. The fruit fly was the first animal to travel to space. This happened in . Did you know that fruit flies and humans have some things in common? They can remember things just like us, and they even fall sick like we do! Which is why scientists love to study fruit flies in space. After all, it's easier to send flies to space than humans! And this is why fruit flies are known as model organisms. Do you know who else has been to space? Albert the monkey, Laika the dog, Ham the chimpanzee, and Arabella the spider!	./Story text files/372.txt	3124	14	5.567398119122257	279	40	97	37.58024691358025	52	29	20	8.246913580246913	43	38	205	114	5	1.2809278350515463	358	30
Sarla liked to watch birds fly. One day, during science class, she looked out of the window and saw an eagle gliding in the sky. How happy the bird must be! She also liked to see planes flying. “Here, what's your name? Should you not be looking at the board?” asked the new teacher in Sarla's class. Sarla got up hastily and said, “Sorry Madam, I was watching an eagle. I wish we could fly like a bird, or like an aeroplane. . . .” “What is your name?” “Sarla.”“Oh how nice! Do you know that Sarla was the name of the first Indian women pilot too? My name, Hamsa, means a swan. Swans are one of the largest flying birds, you know,” said the teacher. “You must spend some time in the library, Sarla. I'm sure there are many books about birds and flights, and machines that fly like aeroplanes.” Over the next few days, Sarla happily learnt a lot about birds, and about aeroplanes.Sarla learnt that human beings can fly too, but not like birds. We can fly to any city in the world in an aeroplane, one of mankind’s greatest inventions. With the help of this great machine, we can also experience the joy of being airborne. Birds are aerial creatures that do not need an external machine to fly. Usually, a bird's wings are bigger than the rest of its body. The wings are very light, making it possible for birds to fly.Aeroplanes are huge and very heavy. Just like birds, aeroplanes have wings on both their sides which help them to fly. The wings of the plane are shaped just like those of birds  curved on the top and flat on the bottom which helps them to fly high up in the sky.Birds flap their wings to fly, but of course we have never seen an aeroplane flapping its wings! Birds flap their wings as they use the wind to push their body upwards. Aeroplanes also fly with the help of the force of the wind. This machine uses the engine inside its body to create wind that flows below the plane.An engine is a very strong machine which acts like the brain of the plane. Just like a bird uses its mind and logic to navigate its flight, engines help planes to push them above the ground and to help them move forward. When the plane’s engines burn fuel, they release hot gases at high speeds which push on the air behind the engine, moving the plane forward.Cars and other vehicles with engines move forward too. But they cannot go up in the sky like planes. The wind flows over and under their wings which are shaped like birds’ wings and lifts the plane into the sky and keeps it there. Planes also have tails, just like birds, to keep them steady and help them change direction. ٴPlanes need big long roads to take off and land. These long roads are called runways and planes need to travel very fast on the runway before they can take off into the air. Planes need to gain a lot of speed to lift off in the air. Most aeroplanes can take off only if they are moving fast enough. The runway is an important part of the airport as it gives aeroplanes enough time to increase their speed and ultimately take off.Planes know where they have to go because they are steered by pilots. The pilots control the plane from a place in the front of the aeroplane called the cockpit. They keep in contact with the airport (a place from where the planes take off and land) through very accurate and modern devices. Just like there are signals and police to help us on the roads, there are air traffic controllers who tell pilots when and where to fly; and when it is safe to take off or land. A plane is actually a giant bird. It is not only shaped like a bird, it also allows us to fly, though not like birds! Sarla wants to be a pilot and fly aeroplanes when she grows up.Did You Know? India’s first aircraft was the Harlow which first flew in July . The first pilot license in India was awarded to JRD Tata in February  by the Aero Club of India and Burma.The fastest jet aircraft in the world is the Lockheed SR Blackbird which flies at a speed faster than the speed of sound. Sarla Thakral was the first Indian woman to fly an aircraft. She was also the first woman pilot to accumulate over  hours of flying.Let's take off! Have fun with friends with these activities: . Make paper planes and see whose plane goes the farthest. Is it the paper or the way it has been made that makes a paper plane go faster? Observe what happens when each plane is launched. Is there a difference if you blow over, or into or under the plane before you shoot it off? . FlyDon't fly Game: Get a group of friends to 'fly' around the room, without touching each other. The den stands in a corner and calls out the names of flying or nonflying objects. When a nonflying object (like table) is called, the 'planes' must 'land' (sit down). Whoever makes a mistake is the next den.	./Story text files/127.txt	4750	16	5.462655601659751	417	65	177	65.91549295774648	25	46	37	13.619718309859154	18	53	319	163	5	1.3517495395948436	503	40
It was a holiday for Amma. She was reading a book. Anil had a holiday too. He wanted to do. . . . SOMETHING! “Amma, I want to see what is in that blue box!” said Anil. “Later, Anil,” said Amma.Anil put a stool over a chair. He climbed up to get the box down. “No, no! Not that one! All the boxes on top of that will fall on our heads, Anil!” said Amma.Anil was very angry. He was angry with his mother.“Come, let’s go to the market and get you something,” said Amma.Anil was very angry even after they went to the market. “I want that one!” he said, pointing at an orange. “No, no, not that one! The fruits will all fall down!” said the shopkeeper.“I want that book!” said Anil. “No, no, not that one!” said the shopkeeper. “Take this one.”“I want that one!” shouted Anil, almost pulling out a samosa from a high stack of samosas. “No, no, not that one!” warned the shopkeeper. “All my samosas will fall to the ground!”“I want that one!” said Anil loudly. He was now in a very, very bad mood. “No, no, not that one!” said the flower seller. “Don’t touch them! They will wilt.”By now, Anil was crying loudly. Everyone was looking at Anil.“I want that one! The black one!” said Amma loudly. Anil stopped crying suddenly. “Amma, no, no! Not that one!” said Anil.“Let’s take this brown one!” said Anil. Then Anil gently lifted the brown puppy on top of a pile of puppies. “Amma, I am very angry with you! All the puppies would have fallen down!” Amma smiled. Anil was smiling too. He was not angry at all now.	./Story text files/225.txt	1505	13	5.285714285714286	151	17	72	23.688524590163933	56	5	15	5.655737704918033	52	9	108	60	3	1.2211981566820276	205	12
In the fishing village of Kovalam, Kali Veerapathiran is a hero. Not because he is an actor. Not because he has fought off villains. He’s a hero because he learnt to dance.It's the year  and Kali is eight years old. Like many boys, he goes to school, plays with his friends, watches TV. Unlike many boys, Kali also dances. Kali loves to watch Padmini dance on TV. She is a famous actor and a fantastic dancer. He pretends to wear a salangai (ankle bells) and dances Bharatanatyam, just like her. Thari thana jonnu thimi Thaka thari kita thaka Thathinginathom Thathinginathom Thathinginathom .Kali becomes such a good dancer that his teachers ask him to perform at school programmes. Soon, he is known in the little fishing village as a Bharatanatyam dancer. One day, Sarah Chanda, who manages a hospital in Chennai, sees him perform on stage. Ditheiyum tha thaa thei Ditheiyum tha thaa thei She is astonished to see such a talented boy. She’s moved that he’s gotten so far by himself.“Would you like to learn Bharatanatyam in Kalakshetra?” she asks him after the performance. Kali laughs at first. Dance? The Dalit community rarely had the opportunity to learn, let alone master, Bharatanatyam. In Kali’s family, there is never enough money to spare for dance classes. And who has heard of boys dancing for a living? But Sarah is serious. “You must learn Bharatanatyam in a proper school, Kali,” she says. “I will pay your fees.”Sarah arranges for Kali to visit Kalakshetra, one of the best dance schools in the country. It is a beautiful place in Chennai with lots of trees. Leela Samson, the head of Kalakshetra who is also a renowned Bharatanatyam dancer, tells Kali to perform for them. Kali ties a saree crookedly over his trousers and dances to a film song. The teachers think he has the makings of a classical dancer.But Kali can’t decide what he wants to be when he grows up. Should he be an actor, a Collector, a teacher, a biotechnologist, or a dancer? His friends and family don’t really help. “Who has ever learnt dance and made any money afterwards? It’s a waste of time!” growls Kali’s maama. “Only girls dance! You’ll become girlish,” his friends tease him.Amma asks Kali what his heart wants. “Do you love dancing? Does it make you feel good? Is that what you want to do always?” “Yes! Dance is all that and more for me, Amma,” he replies. “Then don’t listen to anyone. If it makes you happy, learn dancing.” As usual, Amma has all the answers.So after his final school exams, Kali begins to learn three kinds of folk dances at DakshinaChitra. Oyilaatam Dimtha nakadi naka dhina dhina Dimtha nakadi naka dhina dhina Thapattam Tha kukuku tha kukuku tha kukuku thaa tha Tha kukuku tha kukuku tha kukuku thaa tha Karagattam Datta daguna, daguna Datta daguna, dagunaNext month, Kali begins learning Bharatanatyam at Kalakshetra. The first few days in school are scary and quiet. When the work gets too much, and his legs hurt, he cries to Amma. “Do you want to herd buffaloes?” Amma asks him sternly. “No!” “Then go back and do your best.”Kali begins to adjust to this new world. He makes friends. When language is a problem – not all his classmates know Tamil – Kali speaks using mudras. “Did you go home for the holidays?” “Have you eaten?”At Kalakshetra he becomes a skilful dancer. He becomes lean and fit and full of energy. He can now dance for hours. He learns Carnatic music as well. He makes many friends among the students who have come from all over the country and the world. They share their hopes, dreams, and even the food they bring from their homes!Kali starts getting invitations to perform all across India and the world! He travels by bus, train and aeroplane to many places. His akkas tease him. “Do you remember you could not even sit in a bus without throwing up?” Kali laughs as well. It is true. As a child, he would carry a lemon and a plastic bag with him on bus rides. As the years pass, Kali wins awards for his performances. He starts a dance school called Koothambalam in Kovalam.Now, Kali is ready for another performance. He puts on his makeup carefully. He wears his costume with ease. The velvet curtain goes up. Kali begins to dance.Kali the dancer At the age of , Kali Veerapathiran is perhaps the only male dancer who has mastered the classical dance form Bharatanatyam, as well as three ancient Tamil folk dance forms, according to The People’s Archive of Rural India. Born in Kovalam, a struggling fishing village, not far from Chennai in Tamil Nadu, Kali lost his father very young. It was his mother Ellamalli Veerapathiran, a construction labourer, who worked doubly hard to raise him and his many siblings. Sarah Chanda who is a member of the managing committee of Gremaltes Hospital in Chennai, sponsored his education at Kalakshetra, India’s premier dance school.He has also studied at DakshinaChitra under Kannan Kumar. Having completed his PG Diploma in dance, Kali has started Koothambalam, a dance school in Kovalam. Kali was featured in a documentary film by the People’s Archive of Rural India; many newspapers and TV channels have carried his interviews. He’s won awards for his dance, including the Music Academy’s ‘Spirit of Youth’ award.About The People’s Archive of Rural India (PARI) The People’s Archive of Rural India is a living journal on, and an archive of, the world’s most complex countryside. The FounderEditor P. Sainath and his team, including an army of volunteers, hope to document the stories of  million people speaking well over  languages.

“Meera, I went to your school today!” Amma said one day. “Really?” Meera said. “And the gate was wide open, and the watchman was missing!” “Oh! He was in our classroom, to see why our teacher had screamed!” “And why did your teacher scream?” Amma asked. “Because Rohan began crying!”“And why did Rohan cry?” Amma wanted to know. “Because the snake he had brought back from the zoo had eaten his mouse! And then the teacher screamed and the watchman came running!” “But I went to your classroom, and there was nobody there!” said Amma.“We were all hiding in the Staff Room,” Meera said. “Because Rohan’s snake was in our classroom!” “But Meera, when I went to the Staff Room, I didn’t see anyone there!”“That is because we had all run away to the Principal’s Room,” Meera said. “Because Rohan said the snake was following us!” “But when I went to the Principal’s Room, it was empty!” Amma said.“We couldn’t stay there,” Meera said, “because Rohan’s snake was looking for him. We climbed up to the terrace and stayed there till the bell rang!” “And I waited and waited in your school, all alone!” Amma said.“Not all alone, Amma, you had the snake for company!” “The snake!” Amma said, sitting down with a thump on a chair.	./Story text files/295.txt	1220	12	5.936507936507937	100	26	80	38.38709677419355	18	13	15	7.967741935483871	16	15	74	52	3	1.3725490196078431	147	6

No part of this text may be reproduced for commercial use without express permission of the author. For Jacques and SonjaMac was a very big dog. Mac lived in a house with a very small kitchen, where Mac loved to sleep on the cool floor. This caused lots of problems.Mrs Smith would come into the kitchen and ask, “Why have I got such a large dog in the middle of my very small kitchen?” Mac would see he wasn't wanted, and slink away to the hall where the floor was almost as cool, but the smells weren't as nice.Just when Mac had begun to settle down Baby Katia came crawling along the floor of the hall. She bumped into Mac, and let out a small squeal, ” EEEIKK. ” . Mrs Smith looked over and threw her hands up in the air again, saying, “Why have I got such a big dog in my small passage way?” Picking up the baby she chased Mac out of the hall.Mac looked up with droopy Mac eyes, and saw he was not wanted there either, and decided to slink away to the bathroom. In the shower the floor was always cool, sometimes a little damp, but always perfectly shaded for snoozing. Mac didn't like the soap smell, but he thought maybe at least I'll be safe here out of the way for a while.Right at that moment, Katia's big brother Tyron, who hated getting up too early in the morning, choose to get up and wandered down stairs to have a shower. When Tyron saw Mac in the shower he said to him, “Mac, I am happy for you to have a shower with me, but I don't think you are going to like it.” Mac looked up at Tyron with his big droopy Mac eyes, and rumbled a Mac rumble, ” GRMMRMRL.”Mac tried to decide if Tyron wanted him to go or stay. He paused in thought, half standing up and half lying down in the shower. Tyron said: “Mac if you don't believe me I can show you.” He turned the tap on very softly to let Mac know what might be coming.Mac suddenly felt something cold and wet, he looked at Tyron a bit startled. Then he realized Tyron was just warning him there was more coming and he wouldn't much like it, and perhaps he better go. So he ambled back to the hall – looked around to see if the 'coast was clear', and sunk down into his favorite snooze position.The coast was not clear for long, Mr Smith came back from reading his paper and saw Mac. “Mac, old boy, why do you, such a big dog, choose to sit in such a small passage?” he asked. “You know you shouldn't be here, Mrs Smith will find you and you don't want that do you?” Mac looked up with his big droopy Mac eyes, and rumbled softer this time. . . . “Grmmgrl.”Mac didn't know what to do now, it was hot outside, and the new puppy would be out there and want to play. Mac didn't want to play now, he wanted to sleep. The only place Mac could go for really good shade was on the balcony, but he was afraid of climbing up the stairs. The stairs were so BIG and STEEP and SCARY looking.He tried to slink back to the kitchen, but Mrs Smith spied him creeping in, “Mac, why do I have such a big dog trying to creep into my small kitchen again?” She threw her hands up again, for the third time that morning. “Mac what will I do with you?  Outside now!”It was getting closer to midday, and it was getting hotter by the second. Mac wished he didn't have a fur coat. There were lots of trees to lie under, but the ground was all prickly and Mac didn't like it. He looked at the stairs, he wanted to go up and lie under the table on the cool balcony floor, but they were terrifying. They were so big and steep, he didn't know how he would come down. Maybe he would get stuck up there, and if no one found him he might miss his dinner. Or maybe his legs would fall through the gaps and he would be trapped, Then the Cat would taunt and tease him until someone came to the rescue.While thinking of all the terrible things that might happen if he tried, he slowly ambled over to his least hated tree where he lay down in the prickly grass. Soon after he lay down to snooze, the new puppy came bounding up to him. “Whatchya doing Mac? Watchya doing?” “GrrrrrrMm” . Said Mac. “Whatchya doing Mac? Watchya doing? !” “GRRMMMLL” Said Mac, this time in a more menacing Growly voice. The puppy should know what that meant, he thought.But noooo. . . The puppy was young and very eager but not yet very bright, “Mac – watcha doing, don't ya wanna come and play with me?” She said, still waiting expectantly for a reply. Mac tried to ignore the puppy and rolled over to face the tree.“Mac, I'm gonna go chase the Cat – I saw him just now. Mac don't you wanna chase the Cat with me?” Mac put his paws over his head and pretended not to see or hear. She just ran up the stairs on to the balcony, if you wanna come with me, I think she's trapped up there.”Mac was going to roll over again when his ears pricked up as he caught the word 'Balcony'. “Little Dipper” , he said slowly in a bit of a mumble grumble, not wanting to sound too interested, ” Do you know how to get on to the balcony?”Little Dipper didn't quite understand what he said because he was mumbling, but was so surprised and glad that Big Mac was talking to her she was eager to give a good answer. ” Sure I do” , she replied. ” So how do you?” asked Mac. ” How do you what?” replied Little Dipper ” How do you get onto the balcony?” asked Mac. ” Well by the stairs of course” , replied Little Dipper.Mac shuddered a bit at the thought of the stairs, but tried not to let Dipper see. ” Well I know by the stairs, but how?” Mac asked. “Those stairs are awfully big, and you are so very small. And what if you can't get down again?” Mac inquired further. ” But I normally always get down – why shouldn't I?” replied Dipper. ” You always get down OK?” said Mac. ” Yep always” , said Dipper. “But how?” asked Mac.Dipper looked at Mac, she was only one and a half, turning two years old soon, but she had been climbing stairs ever since she could remember. She tried to think how she did it, but couldn't remember – she just did, and she found it difficult to understand why Mac was asking so many questions.Then she thought, maybe it's because he's never climbed the stairs. Dipper thought very hard, and very long, until she decided for sure she had never seen Mac climb the stairs. “Mac” , she said, ” do you want me to show you how I climb the stairs?” Mac, coughed a little, and mumbled, “ “Grmmbl, er, well I would. But just to make sure you don't hurt yourself or get stuck.” Then he added, “You better show me a few times, to make really sure.”Dipper agreed, and they walked off together for the first time since she could remember. Mac, pleased that Dipper would show him the stairs, and Dipper, pleased that Mac wanted to play with her at last.At the top of the stairs they settled down under the table on the cool balcony floor. The Cat was gone, but Mac and Dipper had both forgotten. They lounged down in their favourite snooze positions and dreamed of pleasant doggy things.The EndMORE BOOKS!

"Today is Vasant Panchami. My parents say it is the first day of spring. Spring is the season between winter and summer. It is called Vasant Ritu in Sanskrit.In many parts of India, people pray to the goddess of learning, music and art on this day. Many birds are sitting on the tree near my house. I think they are singing to me.The leaves on the tree are new and shiny. Just like my new frock. Amma is also wearing a yellow sari ― such a pretty colour ‘basanti’, and such a pretty name!Grandpa wants me to plant a tree. “But why?” I ask. “So that you will have a friend to grow up with, Meenu,” he says. “Spring is a good season to start something new.”We go to the garden. Grandpa and I dig a hole in the ground and plant a sapling. “How tall will it grow?” I ask him.""Wait and watch, dear Meenu! "" he says. The squirrels are chasing each other. Tingu, the cat, chases a squirrel. And I want to chase Tingu.The garden is full of flowers. I like the yellow roses the best and Grandpa likes the white jasmine. There is a carpet of leaves under some trees.Many trees have flowers. I like spring! Everything looks so pretty in spring!Tomorrow is Holi. School is closed for two days. We have made a huge Holika with twigs, and pieces of wood. Some of us went to the forest and brought tesu flowers. Manu put the flowers in a tank of water. The water has turned a bright orange!Tomorrow we will play Holi with the orange water. We will get gujia and puris to eat. Spring is such a happy season. It is not cold, it is not hot, and it is not wet. I can play all the time!"	./Story text files/278.txt	1565	15	5.588957055214724	144	19	92	36.285714285714285	35	7	19	8.214285714285714	25	17	109	54	4	1.2893401015228427	190	7

ALL TYPES OF AIRCRAFT This Book Belongs to __________________________________________________An aircraft is a craft that flies through the air. There are many different types of aircraft.An aeroplane is a type of aircraft, that has fixed wings for lift, and a means of propulsion.  Means of Propulsion is a fancy way to say  a way to move on its own. There are big aeroplanes, and small aeroplanes,There are VERY big aeroplanes, and very small aeroplanes,Some aeroplanes have jet engines, and some have propellers. sA glider is an aircraft which flies without a motor, it uses air currents for lift.A glider needs to be launched, by towing or by a winch, A motor glider uses a motor to launch, then stows the motor after takeoffA helicopter is an aircraft that uses rotating blades like wings to create lift.A helicopter can also have a piston engine,or a jet engine.A hot air balloon is an aircraft which is lighter that air. It's just like a party helium balloon, floating into the air when you let go.And, just like a party helium balloon, They come in all sorts of different shapes and sizesThe balloon pilot lets the gas cool to come down, and heats it up to rise.Airships are like balloons, filled with gasses lighter than air. This enables the airship to float into the air like a balloon.But, unlike a balloon, they also have a means of steering and propulsion. Airships are also sometimes called 'zeppelins' or 'blimps'Because of their complex design, and a poor accident history during their early years, there are only a few airships still in operation today. The last flight of the HindenburgSome aircraft are built to do a special job.Aerobatic aircraft Like aerobatic aeroplanes, are built for doing aerobatic flying, for displays, competitions, or joy rides.Military aircraft, work to defend the people and the country they belong to.Agricultural aircraft help farmers with their job.There are aircraft that help to save peoples lives;Working as firefighters, air ambulances, and in search and rescue.Which aircraft do you want to fly?Draw a picture of your favourite aircraft here.Write about your favourite aircraft here.

"Mamma put Sparrow's lunchbox into her schoolbag and folded her wings around her. ""Have a good day, darling, "" she said. ""Pay attention, be polite. . . "" ""Uff Mamma! "" laughed Sparrow. ""You say the same thing every day! """"And remember, "" said Mamma. ""Stay away from Snake  he's different. "" Sparrow wished Mamma hadn't said that. Snake was her best friend. But Mamma didn't approve of Snake. ""His people eat our people! "" she always said. ""Sparrows and snakes can never be friends. ""On the other side of town, Snake's Pappa was packing his lunchbox with birds' eggs. ""Today's special, son! "" he said proudly. ""But I hate eggs, Pappa, "" groaned Snake.""We've always eaten them in this family! "" said Pappa sternly. ""Now off you go. And remember, stay away from Sparrow! "" Snake slithered away, feeling angry. ""Sparrows are different, "" Pappa called after him. ""You can't be friends with your food! ""When Snake met Sparrow at school, they knew. ""Your Mamma said. . . ? "" asked Snake. Sparrow nodded. ""Your Pappa too? "" Snake nodded. ""Our parents are wrong, Sparrow, "" said Snake. ""Let's show them that we are more samesame than different. """"Great idea! "" said Sparrow. ""Let's! "" She pulled out a sheet of paper and drew two circles on it  like this.""In the yellow part of the left circle, "" said Sparrow, ""we put down 'Just Sparrow' things. In the blue part of the right circle, 'Just Snake' things. These are all ways in which Snake and Sparrow are DIFFERENT. "" Snake was puzzled. ""I thought we wanted to think of ways in which we are SAME! "" ""That's what the green part in the middle is for, "" smiled Sparrow.""First, let's think about how we look, "" said Sparrow. ""Samesame or different? "" ""VERY different, "" sighed Snake. ""I'm long, hairless and thin. You're small, plump and soft. "" “You're right, "" said Sparrow. ""I look like a powder puff, "" she drew a powder puff in the yellow crescent, ""and you look like a ropesorough. "" She drew a rope in the blue crescent.""Now, "" she said. ""How do we move? "" ""VERY differently, "" Snake said, looking even sadder. ""You fly through the air, flapflapping. I slither along the ground, zig zagging. "" ""In other words, "" said Sparrow. ""I move like a plane, and you move like a train. ""Snake sighed. ""Cheer up, Snake, "" said Sparrow briskly. ""Let's see now, what do we eat? "" ""VERY different things, "" Snake's eyes filled with tears. ""But I don't eat birds' eggs. """"I know, "" said Sparrow soothingly. But now she looked glum too. ""Seeds and grass, "" she muttered, as she drew them in the yellow crescent. ""Frogs and rats, "" she sputtered, and drew them in the blue crescent.""Harrrrrumph! "" Snake and Sparrow jumped. It was Headmaster Elephant. ""Why the long faces, kids? "" he asked kindly. ""Oh sir, "" sobbed Snake. ""My Pappa and Sparrow's Mamma say we can't be friends because we are different. "" ""We wanted to show them we were more samesame than different, sir, "" said Sparrow. ""But it isn't working. "" Headmaster Elephant looked at the circles a long time. Then he began to laugh. Snake and Sparrow stared at him. What was so funny? ""Don't you see, kids? "" he said finally, wiping his tears. ""You are doing this all wrong! Let me help you. ""Headmaster Elephant settled down on a bench. ""Now then, Snake, "" he said, ""what do you like doing best? "" ""Playing and chatting, Sir, "" said Snake. ""ESPECIALLY with Sparrow. """"And you, Sparrow? "" ""Chatting and playing, Sir, "" said Sparrow. ""ESPECIALLY with Snake. "" ""Right, "" said Headmaster Elephant, ""you like doing the SAME things. "" And he drew something  in the green part. ""Next, "" said Headmaster Elephant, ""what makes you happy, kids? "" ""When Miss lets me sit next to a friend, Sir, "" Snake began to smile. ""Samesame, Sir, "" clapped Sparrow.“Aha! "" said Headmaster Elephant. ""You both have the SAME happy place. Green! "" ""All right, what makes you sad, Snake and Sparrow? "" ""That Pappa says I should stay away from Sparrow, sir, "" sighed Snake. ""That Mamma says I should stay away from Snake, sir, "" sighed Sparrow. Headmaster Elephant frowned. ""You are both sad, "" he said, ""for the SAME reason  your parents don't let you choose your friends. Green again! """"Now then, "" said Headmaster Elephant, ""who do you think is the best kind of friend? "" ""Someone who loves you. . . "" began Snake. "". . . even though you are different! "" finished Sparrow. ""So you both agree,” said Headmaster Elephant, ""that a true friend loves you no matter what. That makes FOUR 'samesames' and only THREE 'differents'. Samesames win! """"Hurray! "" said Snake and Sparrow. ""Thank you, Headmaster Elephant! "" ""Harrrumph! "" said Headmaster Elephant. ""One last thing. . . "" ""Yes, sir? "" ""Tell your parents I want to see them in my office. First thing tomorrow morning! "" And Headmaster Elephant marched away, looking very fierce indeed.SORT IT OUT! Sorting and grouping are important skills in mathematics. To sort things, you have to ask yourself 'logic' questions like: . What things are same? What things are different? . How are the same things same? How are different things different? . Can the same things be sorted and grouped in more than one way?Think about the many ways in which you can sort and group these toy animals. You can sort them:  According to their colour  blue animals in one circle, yellow in another.  According to their size  small animals in one circle, big ones in another.  According to how they move  animals that walk and animals that fly. Would the groups be different each time? Try it and see!"	./Story text files/118.txt	5487	22	5.287187039764359	552	127	110	34.869281045751634	114	39	23	7.4640522875816995	105	48	379	300	4	1.2046004842615012	751	75
“Anuuuu! Wake up! Sleepyhead!” called Anu's mother. “Mmmm. . . let me sleep!” mumbled Anu. “Ok, then I’ll go see Aunty Jui’s baby by myself,” said Aai*. *Aai, Marathi for motherAnu sat up like a shot. “Baby? Is it a teenytiny baby? Like a doll? Wait for me, I’m coming!”Anu got ready in a jiffy. She gulped down her milk without a fuss. She didn't even cry when her mother combed her hair.The moment Anu entered Aunty’s house she shouted, “Aunty! Where is the baby?” “Shhhh. . .” said Aunty Jui, with her finger on her lips. “Softly. The baby is sleeping.” Sleeping? What a bore. Anu began to sulk.Aai pulled Anu close. “The baby is still very small, Anu. You must not trouble her. After all, you are her big sister!” Big sister! Anu felt very important. But why did the baby have to go to sleep?Just then they heard a thin wail. . . “She is up,” said Aunty, and gave the baby to Aai. “I want to hold the baby,” said Anu. “Oh no, Anu. You won’t be able to. You’re much too small,” said Aai. “But I’m her big sister,” said Anu.Why should the baby sit on Aai’s lap? I want to sit on Aai’s lap too, thought Anu. But Aai said, “Anu, move away! You must not bother baby. See how tiny she is?”The baby was still wailing. “Waah. . .” “Oh dear!” said Aunty. “I think she’s soiled her nappy.” She cleaned the baby and changed her nappy. The baby gurgled happily.Anu was disgusted. What a silly baby. Potty in the nappy! And Aai and Aunty were mad! They didn't even scold the baby.If I just pee in my underwear by mistake, Aai glares at me. But now look at her doing ‘kootchiecoo! ’ to the baby! Wait till I get home. I’ll tell Baba how unfair Aai is.“Let’s go home, Aai!” Anu cried. “Why, Anu, don’t you like the baby?” asked Aunty. “Chee!” said Anu. “Silly baby, does potty in the nappy, doesn’t talk, doesn’t play. I don’t like your baby. Why did you get yourself such a silly baby?”On the way back home, Anu asked her mother, “Aai, when will I become a baby?” “You won’t become a baby again, “ said Aai. “You’ll grow bigger now.” “I don’t want to be big! I want to be a baby and I want to sleep in your lap, and I want to drink milk with a spoon and I want to sit on Baba’s shoulders and go out and. . .” Anu muttered all the way home.The next day Aai said, ” Anu, let’s give your small clothes, toys and cradle to Aunty Jui’s baby, shall we?”“No!” yelled Anu. “That’s my ball and my cradle!” “Okay, what about giving away these clothes then? They’re so small,” said Aai. “No!” shouted Anu again. “I want to wear them, NOW!” So Aai put the small frock on Anu. She even put the little baby bonnet on her head.Anu crawled all over the house. She balanced the ball on her head and wandered around, calling, ‘Curd! Fresh curd! ’ She played with the rattle: ratatattat.Anu climbed into the cradle. She wanted to lie down and suck her thumb. But she didn’t fit! Her feet stuck out at one end, and she couldn’t keep her arms straight. The tight little frock began to pinch. Anu was fed up. This was no fun at all!Anu said to her mother, “Aai, why don’t we give this frock and bonnet and cradle to Aunty Jui’s baby?” “Give it all away? But then what will you do?” asked Aai. “Aai, I’m a big sister now, aren’t I? Once you become a big sister you wear proper clothes, and sleep on the bed.” “Oh really? I had no idea!” said Aai, smiling. Anu wore her own clothes and said, “Aai, tell baby that her big sister has given her all this. You’ll tell her, won’t you?” Anu jumped on to her scooter and went off to play.	./Story text files/277.txt	3497	14	4.967592592592593	393	39	144	27.90909090909091	105	16	36	6.570247933884297	92	29	245	187	4	1.1871455576559546	514	15
"“Kallu get up! You’ll get late for school again! KALLOOO!” The urgent voice pierced through a lovely dream in which Kallu and his friend Damu were catching a huge fish in the river, and for some strange reason the fish was smiling at them. Kallu pushed a bleary face out of his quilt and protested sleepily, “Shabbo it’s too early! I hardly slept!”“No, it isn’t,” his brother Shabbo said firmly. “The sun came up long ago. Ammi has already milked the buffalo and we’ve all had breakfast.” Kallu sat up shivering and looked out of the window and mumbled, “Sun? I don’t see any sun.” “That’s the mist you idiot! Abbu has already gone to work in the vegetable field and all the school kids of our mohalla went past long ago.” “Everyone’s gone?” Kallu about to yawn swallowed it in panic. “Even Munia?” Shabbo nodded silently, his face looking really gloomy. “BAAP RE!”Throwing back the quilt, Kallu struggled out of bed. He couldn’t get late for school again! He just couldn’t! Two days earlier, Masterji had threatened that one more late entrance in class and the punishment would get really serious. He was even thinking of not promoting him to the next class. And that too after he made Kallu stand in a corner holding his ears for hours and hours. “I have to think up a story right now!” Kallu thought desperately as he hunted for his chappals under the bed. “A really wonderful, heartbreaking, very convincing story…” He rushed at super speed to get ready, like he did every morning. He quickly splashed some freezing water on his face to really open his eyes, no bath of course.Luckily it was winter or his mother would have made him take one. He grabbed a shirt, trousers and sweater and hopped about putting them on. Shoving his feet into his chappals, he looked at his younger brother and panted, “You’re so lucky Shabbo! No school for a whole month!” Shabbo sitting by the window, his right leg covered in plaster, said grimly, “Sure! Breaking a leg is great fun. I love sitting here all day, getting so bored I could tear out my hair, while you go off with Damu to play football. Zaroor, I’m having fun!” By the time he finished speaking, Kallu was already out of the house and half way down the lane. Shabbo leaned out of the window to watch his hurrying figure vanish through the swirling mist. Then a huge delighted grin slowly spread across his face.“He’s gone!” Shabbo sang out. “You can come out Munia!” His sister Munia who had been hiding behind a cupboard, came out with an even bigger smile on her face. They were laughing so much that Munia got an attack of hiccups. On his way out, Kallu had grabbed a dry chapati from the kitchen and now taking a bite he mumbled to himself, “A story Kallan Mian! A very convincing, brand new story or you’re standing in the corner again.” Life was a mystery to Kallu. He liked school, he really did. He enjoyed doing sums and learning science, he loved playing football and singing in the school programmes. But then why, oh why, did he find it so hard to get to school on time? Even Masterji couldn’t really understand it.He had suggested sarcastically that Kallu should start sleeping in the school veranda at night, and all the other kids in his class had laughed at Kallu. The problem was that things were getting serious now. If Masterji really did not promote him to class nine, then he was in deep trouble because then his Abbu would make him leave school and make him work in the vegetable fields. Who wanted to pull up spinach and collect carrots and peas when he could go to school? School was a hundred times more fun and he knew that if he could pass the twelfth class board exam, he could find a good job, may be even go to college! Going to college… ah! That was Kallu’s biggest dream. What Kallu really wanted to do, was to complete his twelfth class and then learn about computers.Masterji said he had the brains to do that. Last month, he had taken their class to a computer show in the nearby town and they all thought the machines were totally amazing! The salesman had shown him the correct way to use the mouse and how you could go into the Internet. That was absolute magic! Now Kallu and Damu wanted to become magicians with the mouse, going zipzap across the computer screen. On the way back in the bus, he and Damu had worked out a fantastic plan. Now that the new highway went past Khajuria village, they would open a dhabacumSTD boothcumcomputer centre right beside it. Damu, who dreamed of food all the time would run the dhaba, and Kallu would manage the STD booth.Truck drivers would eat at the dhaba and call home from the STD booth and the people from all the nearby villages sending vegetables, wheat and sugarcane to the wholesale market, could check out the latest market prices on the Internet. “Kya baat! ‘Damodar Dhaba and Kallan Computer Centre’.” Damu smiled and then turned to give Kallu an anxious glance, “If only you would get to school on time.” Whizzing past the tea shop, still munching the chapati, Kallu yelled, “Salaam Dharam Chacha!”Dharampal, the chai shop owner, looked up from the boiling kettle and gave a surprised look, “Arrey it’s Kallu!” Then his grin widened as his eyebrows shot up, “What’s the matter? Did the sun rise from the west today? Where are you going so early in the morning?” “Schooooool!” “Have a pakora first!” And he laughed. “Garam garam Dharam ke pakorey!” Hurrying along Kallu had no time to reply. Dharampal Chacha jokes about everything, he grumbled to himself. Here Kallu was in serious trouble and he was talking about silly pakoras. What was so funny about Kallu getting late for school anyway? It happened every week!Of course, the most disastrous was when he arrived late, day before yesterday. There was a rehearsal for the th January programme and when he crept into the school courtyard, they were already singing “Jaiya he!” of the National Anthem. And Kallu was supposed to be there in front with Damu, Munia and Saru leading the singing. So he stood at the back, sang “Jaiya he!” and was trying to sneak off to class when someone grabbed him by the collar and hauled him back. His heart nearly stopped as he looked up at Masterji’s grim face. “You are again late for rehearsals, so you’re out of the show.” Masterji’s voice was cold as ice.“Oh no! Please Masterji!” Kallu had tears in his eyes and these were real tears, not the ones he could bring out at will. He really wanted to be part of the show. “Please… please…” he pleaded desperately. “I promise I won’t be late again.” “Fine.” Masterji’s voice softened a bit. “I’ll let you go this time, but one more late mark and you’re out! Get that?” Kallu nodded with a sniff. By then they had reached Kallu’s classroom and as Kallu headed to his seat, he said, “Where are you going? Stand in the corner, holding your ears.” His classmates had already begun to giggle when Masterji came up with the final, terrible threat, “May be I won’t promote you. Kallan  failed in eighth because of late marks!” And now he was late again. His life was over.A good story… thought Kallu …a really credible excuse. He had come up with so many in the past, why couldn’t he think of a new one today? In his mind’s eye, he could see Masterji frown in disbelief looking down at Kallu, as he stood stammering and stuttering away. He was concentrating so hard on his story, he ran straight into a herd of buffaloes. Just my luck, he thought in disgust, dodging the mooing cattle. In a life threatening crisis like this, what do I do? I crash into Badri and his fat buffaloes. Puffing and panting, slithering through the mud, he struggled through. Badri, the mad buffalo man in his huge turban, waved a stick in greeting and smiled behind his bushy moustache.“Aren’t you early Kallu? Why don’t you help me wash the buffaloes and then go to school?” “Are you joking?” “No. I’ll give you five rupees. There’s time, you’re early.” “Sure, I’m early,” muttered Kallu irritated. “I’m so early it’s not even today yet, it’s still yesterday. And I’ll also feed your buffaloes and dance with them.” “Heh! Heh!” Badri laughed as he slapped a buffalo on the rump. “You’re really funny Kallan!” Kallu kept running. The whole village is against me, he thought gloomily, even crazy Badri.Can’t they stop joking and teasing a poor boy like me? And then he got busy with the storycum excuse problem once again. Ammi was sick and he had to make breakfast? Nope. He’d tried that one at least twice before. It won’t work again. The goat had run away? Nah! It didn’t work last time. Someone stole his pen? The pen was right there in his school bag. His chappals broke and he had to get them repaired? No way! They were brand new. Going past Damu’s house, he saw his best friend and his sister Saru sitting on a charpai in the courtyard, eating breakfast. Ha! They were late too, Kallu thought in triumph, and they are still eating, so they’ll come in after me, and hopefully Masterji will be so busy yelling at them, he’ll forget about me.Damu looked up, his eyes wide in surprise, “Oye Kallu! Wait for me yar!” “Paranthas, Kallu Bhaiya,” Saru called out. “Gobhi paranthas!” “No time!” Kallu huffed past at full speed. “Meet you in school.” “Theek hai. See you later.” Damu shrugged and went back to eating. Damu and Saru are so lucky, Kallu thought. They lived right next to school. They could even leave home when the school bell rang. As he got to the school gate, Kallu’s heart began to thud really fast. Guess who was standing there, stuffing a paan into his mouth. Masterji! ! Talk of bad luck!Kallu skated to a stop, and began in a nervous rush, “I’m sorry I’m late Masterji, but today it’s not my fault at all! I had to help Shabbo take a bath. You know he’s broken his leg and…” he came to a sudden stop because of an amazing sight. Masterji, the scariest human being on earth, was laughing! “Wait!” Masterji held up a hand, while he tried to stop from choking on his paan. “Why are you telling me a new story today?” “What story?” Kallu tried hard to look shocked. “I never tell stories… I mean… but…” Things are getting very strange here, thought Kallu. “Every word is hundred percent true, Masterji!”“You are nearly fifteen minutes early Kallan,” Masterji’s smile still lingered. “EARLY?” Kallu froze in shock. “WHAT DO YOU MEAN EARLY?” Masterji pointed to his watch, “See? Seven forty five.” “Munia’s not here?” “No one’s here yet.” And Masterji laughed again, sending out a spray of paan juice into the air. “No one except you!” Kallu stood still, “You mean I could have slept more? I had time for breakfast?” He nodded to himself. “Now I know. It’s Shabbo and Munia. I’ll kill them. I really will. Just because Shabbo is bored he’s played this trick on me.”""And you wasted a good story too,” Masterji said sympathetically. “Better come in anyway.” “I’ll make Shabbo pay for this,” Kallu said through gritted teeth. “I really will.” “What will you do?” “I’ll break his other leg! !” said Kallu with a glare."	./Story text files/341.txt	10975	18	5.777118644067796	984	196	235	51.76923076923077	118	90	41	10.461538461538462	102	106	642	538	6	1.4325130499627143	1211	130
“STOP pulling my hair!” shouts Zoya. “First you stop calling me Fatso!” Armaan yells at his sister. “Children, behave yourselves!” says Ma. “Remember, you are at my clinic. There are patients waiting outside. Both of you are disturbing them!”“But Ma –” “Enough! If I hear another sound from either of you, I will punish you both,” says Ma sternly., , . . . a few seconds pass in silence. But the peace does not last! “This is your fault, Zoya. Why do you have to be so stupid?” “Who are you calling stupid, slowpoke? You can’t even spell stupid.” “Stop calling me names! I’ll tell Ma,” says Armaan, pinching Zoya’s arm.“You are such a tattletale!” says Zoya, shoving her brother. Armaan loses his balance. He topples over backwards and bumps into something hard. CRASH!Oh, no! Zoya and Armaan stare at the pile of bones lying on the ground. “See what a mess you’ve made of Ma’s skeleton model!” says an upset Zoya. “This is all your fault! You are the one who pushed me!” yells Armaan.“We better do something quickly! Otherwise, we’ll both be in trouble,” says Zoya. Armaan nods and picks up a bone. “This one could be the head bone. It has two holes for eyes, one hole for the nose, and teeth below.” “You’re right,” says Zoya. “That’s definitely the head bone. This is like a puzzle. We just need to figure out which bone goes where.”“Where do you think this goes?” asks Zoya, picking up a big cage like bone. “Um. . . well,” Armaan makes a fist with his hand and raps the middle part of his body, “I think that cage on top must be the chest. And the space below must be for the tummy.” Zoya nods and smiles. The two of them hold the piece together and mount it onto the stand.“Look at this piece. Don’t these bones look like fingerbones?” asks Zoya, wiggling the small bones at Armaan. “I think this is an arm. Can you look for the other one?“How do you know that it isn’t a leg bone?” asks Armaan. “Watch me!” Zoya sits down and places her hand flat on the floor next to her foot.In no time, Armaan finds the other arm bone and two leg bones. “The hands bones are shorter than the foot bones. We must be right!” says Armaan. Zoya stands on her tiptoes to fix the arm bones while Armaan attaches the leg bones to the skeleton model.They hear Ma's voice outside, telling a patient to get rest, and visit again in a week. It sounds like she’s almost done! Only the skull remains to be fixed. Oh, no! They can’t reach. “Quick, Armaan, pull that chair here,” whispers Zoya. She climbs on to the chair and places the skull right at the top of the skeleton. Armaan drags the chair back to its place. Just in time!“We’ve done it!” Zoya hugs Armaan. Ma walks in. “It is nice to see the two of you hugging. I'm done for the day! Let's go get icecream,” she says.“By the way, you were both very clever to put the skeleton back together correctly,” says Ma. Zoya and Armaan look at each other in surprise.

Once upon a time, in a little village on the banks of the Irrawaddy river, there lived a young woman called Thuza. She was very happily married to handsome young Theingi. But there was one problem that nagged Thuza – her husband believed he was an alchemist and would spend all his time dreaming about ways to turn dirt into gold. All day, and for days on end, Theingi spent his time in experiments, searching for a breakthrough. Soon, all their money was over, and young Thuza had to struggle to buy food for the two of them. She became very worried. “You should find a job soon,” she pleaded with her husband. “We cannot continue like this!” But Theingi wouldn’t listen. “I’m on the verge of a breakthrough! Why do I have to work when we will be rich beyond our wildest dreams? We will soon be able to turn all the dirt we find into gold!” Disheartened, Thuza approached her father, wise old Thet, for a solution. Thet was surprised when he heard that his soninlaw was an alchemist. He thought for a while and asked to see Theingi. Thuza returned home happily that day, for she knew her wise father would have a solution.The next day, Theingi arrived at his fatherinlaw’s house, fully prepared for a scolding. He was taken by surprise when Thet took him aside and whispered, “When I was young like you, I was an alchemist too!” The two of them spent the whole afternoon discussing Theingi’s work. Finally, the old man stood up and said, “Why Theingi, you’ve done everything exactly like I did when I was your age! You are definitely on the verge of a breakthrough! Congratulations! But you seem to be lacking one very important ingredient in your experiments. You will need this when you finally turn dirt to gold. Only recently did I discover this. But I am too old for this task. It requires enormous effort…” “Then let me do it for you, Father!” cried Theingi. He was really excited. All his efforts would pay off at last. “Tell me what the ingredient is!” “Good, you are excited!” said Thet. He leaned closer and whispered, “Son, the secret ingredient is a silver powder that is found only on banana leaves. You will have to plant the bananas yourself and cast certain spells on them. Then, as the plants grow, the powder on the leaves will gain magical powers.”“How much of this powder will we need, Father?” asked Theingi excitedly. “A kilo,” replied Thet. “A kilo!” cried Theingi. “That would require hundreds of banana plants!” “I’m afraid so, Son,” said the old man. “That is why I can’t complete the task myself…” “Don’t lose heart, Father!” said Theingi. “I shall!” Later that evening, the old man taught his soninlaw the magic spells and loaned him the money to start the work. The very next day, Theingi bought a small field near his home and cleared it. Just as he had been instructed, he dug the ground himself and planted the saplings after carefully chanting the magic spells. Every day he went to the field and examined the saplings. He kept the weeds and pests away diligently. When the plants grew and bore fruit, he carefully collected the silver powder from the leaves and kept it safely in a box.There was hardly any powder on each leaf, so Theingi had to buy more land and grow more bananas. But he was determined to do what was needed. It took him several years, but at the end of it all, he had managed to collect enough of the magic powder. He rushed to his fatherinlaw, excited as never before. He would soon be able to make gold from mere dirt! “Father, finally… here is the kilo of magic powder!” he cried. The old man was filled with joy. “Wonderful! ’’ he said. “Wonderful! You’ve done well, Theingi. I’m proud of you. Now I will show you how to turn dirt into gold. But first, let’s get Thuza. We need her help.” Theingi was a little puzzled, but without losing any time, he ran to his wife and was soon back with her. “Thuza,” asked the old man, “what did you do with the bananas when your husband was collecting the powder?” “Why, I sold them, Father,” replied Thuza. “That’s how we earned a living.”“Then you must have been able to save some money too. Theingi grew more than enough bananas…” the old man continued. “Yes, I did,” replied Thuza. “Can we see it?” asked Thet. “Of course, I have kept it safely at home,” beamed Thuza. The three of them went to Theingi’s house where Thuza produced several bags from the loft where she had kept them safely. Thet opened one of the bags, peered inside, and smiled. He then emptied one of the bags on the table. Gold coins tinkled as they fell in a huge, shiny heap. Then he went to the field and came back with a handful of dirt, which he placed next to the heap of gold. “You see, Theingi,” he said, turning to his soninlaw, “you have changed dirt into gold!” Never after that day did Theingi collect any more magic powder from the leaves. But he continued to grow bananas. His “alchemist” fatherinlaw had taught him the best way to turn dirt into gold, after all. He didn’t need the magic powder any more.BANANAGIC! After Theingi’s magic powder from bananas, how about surprising your friends with some magical bananas? ! Tell them about a new variety that you have just discovered – one that grows in slices! MAKE YOUR OWN MAGICAL BANANAS YOU’LL NEED: A few ripe bananas A toothpick or sewing needleHOW TO MAKE IT: . Push the toothpick into the banana somewhere along the seam. . Without taking it out, carefully rotate the toothpick left and right inside the banana. You should cut all the way through the fruit, but not through the peel, mind you. Also, try and keep the toothpick hole as small as possible – the smaller, the lesser it will be visible.. Remove the toothpick and repeat the above step at another spot on the banana, say after an inch. Keep making internal oneinch slices until you have at least five or six. Do these two steps with all the bananas you have. That’s it – your magic bananas are ready to eat. Offer the “new variety” to your friends while telling them a big story about how you discovered them in the field nearby. When your friends peel the banana, imagine the look on their faces when they find that it is already sliced? While inside the skin! Isn’t that some yummy banana magic?	./Story text files/518.txt	6200	16	5.8019323671497585	500	121	159	56.416666666666664	52	56	31	11.425925925925926	40	68	382	239	5	1.471830985915493	606	104
When I woke up in the morning, the sun was shining again. I looked around me, wondering where I was. And then I remembered. I was a baby sea turtle  an olive ridley  in the middle of a big blue world, which I had heard someone call the ocean. There was blue and green water in every direction, and the sunlight was playing games with the clouds. I tucked my flippers beneath my body and floated for a while, letting the current carry me. I did not know where I was. But that does not matter when the sun is shining, and your stomach is full. The sun warmed me, and filled me with new energy.Just as I was beginning to think that I would love to spend the rest of my life here, a school of fish went by. Chasing them was a really big fish. I could tell he was a really hungry fish too. When he saw me, his eyes lit up. “Mmmmm,” he seemed to be thinking, “baby turtle soup!” Moments later, I was swimming as fast as I could, with those big teeth snapping at my little hind flippers. Just when I was beginning to tire, I saw a seaweed raft. A seaweed raft is just that, a floating mass of seaweed and driftwood that travels around the ocean, carried along by the current. On and in the raft are the Drifters, all the sea’s little and notsolittle creatures that float around the ocean, waiting for something to happen. Gratefully, I slipped into the raft. I would not leave this safe haven for many, many years. Being on the raft was like going on a world cruise. I enjoyed it very much, but as I grew up, I decided it was time to explore the big wide world outside the raft.I had heard wonderful things about a place called the Reef where a lot of other turtles lived. Everyone said the Reef was the fairyland of the ocean. They said it was full of beautiful, brightlycoloured creatures, both harmless ones like the clown fish and poisonous ones like the scorpion fish. I wondered how I would find it.All of a sudden, it became very dark. A huge shadow covered me. Frightened, I looked up, only to see the biggest turtle I had ever seen. His back was soft and leathery. I stared. A turtle with a soft back? All the ones I know have very hard backs. The big turtle caught me staring. “Surprised?” he grunted pleasantly. “You shouldn’t be. I’m a leatherback turtle.”“Good name, Sir,” I mumbled. “Where are you going, Sir?” I continued. “To the Reef to live with the other turtles?” “Ah,” sighed the leatherback. “I wish I had that luxury. But no, I am too busy searching for jellyfish. They are all I eat.” “Where do you find them?” I asked.“Out in the deep, deep, sea,” said the leatherback. “Sometimes I have to dive more than a  feet to reach them. And sometimes I go all the way to Canada, where the water gets very cold. No other reptile could survive in such cold waters.” “If it isn’t too rude, Sir,” I said quietly, “can I ask how much you weigh?” “Nearly  kilograms, little one,” replied the leatherback, looking amused. “And I’m proud of all of it, including the fat. For it’s the fat that helps me get through the long migrations. Well, I have to be off now. . .”“Of course, Sir,” I said. “But before you go, could you tell me where I might find the Reef?” “That way,” said the leatherback, pointing with a flipper as he swam off. “Thank you, Sir, and happy hunting!” I called out as I swam towards the reef.It was on the Reef that I met old Green Turtle. My friend Hawksbill, whose mouth is curved like a hawk’s beak, told me old Green was nearly  years old. “My! That’s old!” I said. “How come she looks so young?” “Well,” said Hawksbill, “Green Turtle eats only sea grass and algae, so it took her nearly  years to become an adult. You and I will be adults by the time we are ten.”“Do you know,” he continued, “that when she wants to nest, she migrates to islands in the middle of the ocean? Clear blue lagoons, white sand, they’re beautiful. . .” “Have you been there?” I asked. “Oh yes, sometimes you have to crawl over the coral to get to the beach,” said Hawksbill. ​I shuddered. I would hate to crawl over sharp coral. Soft sand is what I like under my soft belly. “You won’t have to do it, don’t worry,” another ridley told me. “We only nest on soft beaches, like the ones on the coasts of Mexico, Costa Rica, and India. But you’ll see for yourself, when it’s time. . .”“How will I know it’s time?” I asked eagerly as she swam away. “You will, trust me,” was all she would say.I spent some happy years on the Reef, meeting many of my turtle cousins. Apart from green turtles and hawksbills, I met loggerhead turtles  the ones with the really big heads  and plenty of other ridleys like me. And then one day, just like that, I was all grown up, and it was time to go. How did I know it was time? I don’t know. Something deep inside me told me so. I knew I had to swim north with all the other ridleys, all along the eastern coast of India until we reached Orissa, and lay my eggs on the soft beaches there. The little compass in my head would tell me how to get there.“It’s only about  kilometers,” sniffed a loggerhead as he swam off in a different direction. Show off! Just because loggerheads like him sometimes swim almost  kilometres to lay their eggs (from California, all the way across the Pacific Ocean to Japan)! I ignored him, and continued gorging on flying fish, my favourite food. The big journey began. The water around me was full of other ridleys like me, swimming powerfully.It wasn’t an easy journey. Along the way, there were many dangers. Though I was now bigger than most of the fish, there were still sharks that could catch us.But the sharks were not as dangerous as the many fishing nets that we had to swim past. I swam as carefully as I could, avoiding all the nets, especially the terrible trawl nets. I managed to escape them all, but some of my friends weren’t so lucky. Finally, I reached the beach of Gahirmatha, the place where more ridleys nested than anywhere else in the Indian Ocean. It was time to lay my first nest.We always nest at night. I waited until the tide was a little high, so that I wouldn’t have that far to crawl on the beach. I came in with the surf, and felt land under me for the first time since my birth. It felt very strange at first. Slowly, I dragged myself up the beach to find a dry spot.Once I had moved past the hightide line, the sand became very dry and flew all around me as I dragged myself forward with my front flippers. It is very difficult to move on land. I paused to take a breath and looked up. The beach was long and dark.Behind the beach was a huge dune and some bushes. I had heard there was a large forest behind this beach called Bhitarkanika which was full of saltwater crocodiles, king cobras and all kinds of other animals. Then, suddenly, I saw another animal on the beach. It had four legs and it was digging up a turtle nest. I went back into the water as fast as I could. Later that night, I crawled up again, and went up the beach into the Ipomea creepers. At my chosen spot on the beach, I cleared away the dry sand, and made a big pit with my hind flippers. I am very fussy about how exactly I do this. I always put one flipper in after the other, scoop up some sand and throw it out.About two feet deep and shaped like a flask, with a narrow neck leading into a deep cavity, it was a beauty. I then began laying my eggs. , , , . . . , , , . . . , ,  and then I was done. I covered my precious eggs carefully with sand, and thumped it down with my body. Finally I threw some sand around to make sure that no one would find my nest. Quickly, quickly, I crawled back into the sea where I felt much safer.Two weeks later, I was getting ready to nest again. We usually make enough eggs to lay two or three nests during a season. My common sense told me that it would be a good idea to nest again where I had the previous time. It seemed like a good, safe place. That night, as I was waiting in the shallow water for the tide to be right, I noticed a slight change in the wind. It was stronger and blowing from a different direction. Suddenly I realised that there were hundreds, no, thousands, of other turtles all waiting to nest. I knew a lot of other ridleys were also swimming around in the Gahirmatha waters waiting to nest, but I had never seen so many together.And then, we were all rushing up the beach together. The beach was already full. There were thousands of other ridleys, sand was flying in the air, we were all bumping into each other. Finally, I managed to find a clear spot, and dig a nest for myself. The turtle next to me was in such a hurry, she started to lay her eggs even before she could finish digging her nest. I was shocked, we turtles never do that.“It’s an arribada*, lady,” she said, “we all get a little crazy during this time.” Nobody really knows why we do this. But it works for us, because millions of hatchlings hatch at the same time. That way, most of the little ones escape being caught by birds, crabs and jackals. These days, of course, we have humans to worry about as well. * During an arribada  which means ‘arrival’ in Spanish  thousands of olive ridleys come ashore in a frenzy to nest. Scientists still aren’t sure why they do this.Finally, it is time to leave and return to my feeding ground. I will spend a year or two there, eating and building up the energy for another visit to Gahirmatha. Green Turtle, on the other hand, sometimes needs to eat for five or six years before she has the energy to make her next journey to nest. As I leave, I think of the little ones I have left behind. For  to  days, the eggs will remain under the sand, warmed by the sun. And then one day, they will hatch, breaking open their shells with the tips of their snouts. They will huddle together, over a hundred hatchlings under the sand, waiting for the sun to set and the sand to cool. Then, in the darkness, when it is safe, they will come out, all at once. They will see the moonlight bouncing off the sea, and know which way to go. Hopefully they will be no streetlights to make them go in the wrong direction.They will swim against the waves and dive under the oncoming breakers.Oh, there will be big fish and small fish out to get them, and seagulls and eagles, but some will get away. Out into the open sea where they will find their own little seaweed rafts, their floating homes for many years. Then they will grow up, and perhaps they will come to my feeding ground. Perhaps we will meet, though of course I will not know them. Still, I am happy knowing that they are out there somewhere, and that someday they will return like me to this very beach to lay their own eggs, and start the whole wonderful circle of life all over again.A MESSAGE FROM THE OLIVE RIDLEY TO YOU Sea turtles are in danger worldwide, for many reasons. Some species of turtles are killed for their meat, which is used to make turtle soup. The shell of the hawksbill turtle is used to make tortoiseshell products like eyeglass frames and hair accessories. Many turtle eggs and hatchlings are eaten by predators like dogs and crows. But the biggest danger comes from fishing. Many sea turtles get accidentally caught in a variety of fishing nets, drown, and die. In India, there are many conservation groups that are trying to save sea turtles. Each coastal state has one or more such groups.What can YOU do to protect sea turtles? If you live near a beach where turtles come to nest: • Help keep the beach clean so that baby and mother turtles do not get hurt. • Educate the adults in your locality about how streetlights and other lights near the beach can be harmful to turtle hatchlings – once they hatch, hatchlings figure out where the sea is by looking for the reflection of moonlight on water, so if there are other bright lights in the area, they can get confused and wander off in the wrong direction, and into danger. • Find out if your state has a local sea turtle conservation group and see if you can join them. If you don’t live near a beach: Read more and more about sea turtles and talk to everyone you know about the dangers they are facing. Spreading awareness is a BIG part of conservation.	./Story text files/75.txt	12127	16	5.635090609555189	1023	191	366	61.51546391752577	89	105	67	12.907216494845361	65	129	827	387	5	1.3609898107714702	1241	133

Sam was a very curious boy. And what he was curious about was his Christmas present!“Mummy, where is my Christmas present?” asked Sam. She smiled and said, “It is hidden in a secret place, Sam.” Sam stuck his tongue out and went in search of his father.“Daddy, where is my Christmas present?” asked Sam. “It is hidden in a secret place, Sam,” his father replied smiling.“I know what to do!” Sam said. “I will go gift hunting!”He looked behind his father’s desk. And he found. . . a gift box wrapped in red paper. “But this is for aunt Juju,” said Sam reading the tag.So, he slipped into his parents' room. And he found. . . a gift box wrapped in gold paper. “For uncle Alfie,” Sam read aloud from the tag.Then he opened his mother’s cupboard. And he found. . . a gift box wrapped in purple paper. ‘For our daughter Sophie’ was written on the tag.Sam went back to his room and sat on the floor feeling very sad. He had badly wanted to find his present! And then he saw a gift box wrapped in silver paper under his bed!“This is for me!” he shouted, reading the tag.Sam shook the box. He turned it around in his hands. What was inside? Oh, what could it be? Did he open it or leave it in the secret place? Are you curious to know what curious Sam did with his gift?He put it back under the bed and decided to wait for Christmas.	./Story text files/196.txt	1325	15	5.415492957746479	123	19	66	29.837209302325583	34	9	15	6.883720930232558	30	13	94	48	3	1.1787709497206704	177	2
“Hello world!” Keya peeks out of her burrow for the first time ever. The sea is far away from her home. “Ma, can we go play in the water?” “No, no! We have lots of things to do today,” says Ma.“Hurry up, Keya! It’s time to eat. Lots of yummy treats in the sand for us. Oii, don’t wander away!” says Ma.“Who is that, Ma?” asks Keya. “That crab who is in such a hurry and knocking everyone over?” “A Soldier Crab,” says Ma. “Didn’t you notice that she is just like you and I? We do enjoy marching. Left… right… left. . .”“Who is that, Ma?” asks Keya. “HAWW! That crab was just here, and now it’s gone!” “Ah! Look close enough. You will find many, many eyes staring back at you. That’s the Ghost Crab,” says Ma.“Who is that, Ma?” whispers Keya. “Right there, that crab waving at us?” “Hello, Fiddler Crab!” Ma waves back. “He likes to show off his big claw.”“And who is that, Ma?” asks Keya. “Oh, did that crab just hide in the sand?” “Aiii! Stay away from the Moon Crabs,” warns Ma. “They might just eat you for lunch!”“It looks like we are closer to the water now, Ma,” says Keya. “Eeeyyy! The sea is coming in and it will soon gobble up the beach,” says Ma. Keya is sad. It's time to go back to the burrow.“It’s such a big, big world outside,” thinks Keya. “I can’t wait to go out again tomorrow!” Keya slowly falls asleep, her ten legs tired from all the marching. She dreams of visiting the beach again. Left, right, left!Left, right, left… on the sand. Left, right, left… in the waves. Left, right, left… Keya marches on in her sleep.A Cast of Crabs Let’s head to the beach and meet Keya and her crab friends. Most crabs walk and swim sideways. Did you know that a group of crabs is called a CAST? Soldier Crabs: Thousands of Soldier Crabs live together at the edge of mangroves near beaches. They are small and are easy prey for shorebirds. They sift for food in the sand and whatever they don’t eat, they roll into tiny balls and throw away! Ghost Crabs: Because their eyes are on stalks, Ghost Crabs can see all around. But they can’t see what’s on top of their heads! They are one of the fastest runners on the planet. They are the colour of the sand, and you can barely see them as they dart across the beach.Fiddler Crabs: Male Fiddler Crabs have one large claw, and they use it to show how big and powerful they are. Because of the way they swing this claw, they are also called Dhobi Crabs. It looks as if they are washing clothes by swinging an arm. Moon Crabs: Moon Crabs have flat, paddle like legs that help them in swimming and digging. They feed on other crabs and smaller fish. When threatened, they draw their legs up under their hard shell and pretend to be dead.Spot the Crab! Hidden around Keya’s beach are many crabs. Can you find them all?

If you ever see a girl blowing her nose into a dosa, don’t be surprised. That’s Uma. She is what everyone calls a very, very nice girl. But even though she is a very, very nice girl, she has one bad habit.She loves playing with her breakfast. Whenever Amma turns her back, she grabs her breakfast and makes it vanish in clever little ways.That’s how the dosa becomes a hanky! She folds it into a neat, crisp triangle and pins it onto her uniform.When it’s vadas for breakfast, she slides them onto her fingers like rings and pretends to be a great queen wearing many precious vada jewels.Bondas are her least favourite. So she stuffs them into the sides of her mouth and pretends she has chubby cheeks like that girl from Class B. “Bye, Amma!”Uma’s Amma is a great cook and her idlis are famous in their colony. But Uma doesn’t care much for Amma’s cooking. Instead, she fills her pockets with those famous softsoft idlis and uses them as cushions on the school bus.Uttapams become hats, and pongal is fed to Malligai the cat. Nothing can make Uma eat her breakfast. But today, she faces a small problem. Amma has made soft, mushy, squishy rawa upma and served it on her favourite plate.But what can Uma do with this upma? She can’t pin it to her uniform. It wouldn’t stay. She can’t wear it as rings. She can’t stuff it into her cheeks. It wouldn’t fit. It would melt. She can’t use it as a cushion. It would be a useless one! She can’t wear it as a hat. It would fall off! And she can’t feed it to Malligai the cat because everyone knows that cats hate upma!Uma wonders what to do with the upma. As she thinks and blinks and twirls her curls, she puts a spoon of upma in her mouth by mistake. Oooh! What was that she just bit into? A salty, roasted cashew filled with ghee! Yum!Uma takes another bite hoping to find more cashews. But she bites into something crunchy, fresh and juicy instead. Carrots! Mmm!She takes another bite, wondering what she would find this time. Owwwwiee! What is this strong and spicy little piece? Ah… ginger!Curious, Uma can’t stop now. But oooh, aaah, ouch! She just bit into a green chilli and her mouth is burning! Uma gobbles up all the upma to put out the fire in her mouth.The fire is finally out. And her plate is empty!“Uma! Where did the breakfast vanish to this time?” asks Amma. “Into my tummy,” says Uma.Uma no longer plays with her breakfast. She has become a very, very, very nice girl. Everyone’s happy with her these days. Everyone except Malligai the cat! Pssst… so if you find her somewhere, feed her some pongal, okay?	./Story text files/276.txt	2567	15	5.752851711026616	212	51	141	41.09836065573771	42	19	25	8.704918032786885	38	23	148	115	4	1.3694267515923566	291	23
"Tooka and Poi love collecting things. Smooth pebbles from the riverside, twirly and tickly fern leaves, bright red buttons that have fallen from a school uniform — Tooka and Poi pick them all up. Every day, they meet after school, near the bendy coconut tree by the river, and wait for their best friend. At five o’ clock on the dot, Inji arrives, huffing and puffing like an old school bus. Inji is a friendly dog with eyes the colour of chocolate and a tail that never stops wagging.Together, Tooka, Poi, and Inji walk, heads bent, scanning the gleaming road, the tufts of grass, and mosscovered rocks for interesting things to collect. Their favourite thing to collect are seeds! Tooka and Poi collect shiny red seeds that look like ladybirds, spiky burrs that stick to their clothes, and the giant bean shaped pods of the copper pod tree.The pods make a delightful tshhtshtshh sound when Tooka and Poi shake it about. Poi loves to make up funny songs to go with the seed music.“Inji is the best of dogs, She likes big flowers and little frogs, And birds and seeds and ants and snails, But best of all, she loves her tail!” Over and over she sings these songs, making Tooka laugh and Inji bark happily.Tooka, Poi, and Inji are sitting by the tamarind tree. Tooka’s favourite seeds are the pudgy pods from around this tree. He loves to suck on its sour flesh until he gets to the shiny brown seeds inside. It makes Tooka’s face scrunch up in funny ways and the hair on the back of his neck stands up.Suddenly they hear a small squeaky voice say “Hellllooooo. "" Tooka and Poi look at each other, puzzled. They can’t see anybody. “Up here! Up here!” they hear the voice say again. Tooka and Poi look up and down, and all around, but there isn’t a person in sight.“It’s me, Pacha. I’m the tamarind tree.” Inji barks loudly and wags her tail faster than normal. Phat phatphat it goes, back and forth. “Why hello Inji,” Pacha the Tree says. “I haven’t seen you in days!” Tooka and Poi become still as statues. Their eyes widen and their mouths freeze in big 'O' shapes. Finally, Poi smiles shyly and says, “Hello Pacha the Tamarind Tree. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Poi!” Then she gives the tree a big hug.Pacha giggles, “I’ve never been hugged by a little girl before! It feels tickly!” “And we’ve never met a talking tree before!” Tooka says, cheerfully, “So this is an adventure for all of us.” Hearing this, Pacha laughs loudly, making the leaves on his branches glow a brighter green. “What are you two up to today?” Pacha asks. “We’re collecting things!” Tooka and Poi say!Tooka and Poi show Pacha the Tree their bag of flowers, pebbles, and sticky tamarind. “How lovely that you’re collecting seeds!” Pacha says. “Do you know I came from one of those little tamarind seeds? And look at me now, all grown up with so many branches and a big family of sparrows and squirrels and crows living with me.” “What do you mean?” Tooka asks. Inji barks enthusiastically. Bow! Bow! Bow! Inji said but Tooka is sure it sounds like “How? How? How?”“Those seeds you’re collecting,” Pacha explains, “They’re all tree babies.” “They are?” Poi asks, her eyebrows scrunched into squiggly black lines. “Do all seeds grow into tamarind trees?” Poi asks, trying to remember how many seeds she has at home. “Oh no!” Pacha replies. “Seeds grow into all sorts of things.” “Do you have any fruit in your bag?” Pacha asks. Tooka nods and pulls out a small, red apple and a soggy banana.“There you go!” Pacha says, excitedly. “Now bite into the apple until you reach the centre. You’ll see little brown seeds sitting there.” “They’re like shiny little bugs!” says Poi. “Aren’t they pretty?” Pacha asks. “Those little seeds grow into apple trees” “Now break the banana in half and see what you find,” Pacha instructs.“I see the seeds!” Tooka says excitedly. “They look like a sleeping millipede!” “Seeds come in all shapes and sizes” , Pacha says while Inji gobbles the last of the apple. “Are they all tree babies?” Poi asks. “Yes!” says Pacha. “And they all have a little plant inside, waiting to come out and see the world.”As Tooka, Poi, and Inji walk home that evening, they look closely at all the trees along the road. How pretty the leaves of the coconut tree look as they dance in the wind. How beautiful the red gulmohar flowers are against the bright blue sky. How nice and rough the bark of the mango tree feels under their palms. And how wonderful that something as big and important as a tree starts out as a teeny, weeny little seed.Tooka, Poi, and Inji still meet every evening after school. But now, Tooka and Poi collect things in which they can plant the seeds they collect. Old shoes, empty coconut shells, even used plastic bottles — everything can be turned into pots. And every once in a while, they stop by for a chat with Pacha the Tree.Pacha’s Super Seed Guide Hello! I’m Pacha, the tamarind tree, but I go by all sorts of names. I’m called imli in Hindi, puli in Tamil, and tentul in Bengali. Scientists call me Tamarindus indica. Let me introduce you to some of my seed friends. You may have seen them on your dinner plate.Molagu Common name: Red chilli Scientists call me: Capsicum annum Chillies come in all shapes, sizes, and colours, and are grown all over the world. Its seeds are small, circular, and flat, and add spice to dal and bhaji. Careful when you touch them, they'll make your fingers burn! Kaapi Common name: Coffee Scientists call me: Coffeea Arabica You know the coffee your parents drink every morning? That comes from coffee berries. The seeds from the berries are dried, roasted, and then powdered. Coffee bushes grow best in hilly regions of South India. Chakka Common name: Jackfruit Scientists call me: Artocarpus heterophyllus Berries, apples, bananas, watermelon, and jackfruit — all fruits have seeds in them. Some seeds we cannot eat, like that of the mango. Others, like the jackfruit, are used to make curries after they are soaked in water.Thenga Common name: Coconut Scientists call me: Cocos Nucifera Nearly every part of the hard, brown coconut is useful to us. The hairy, hard outside part is used to make rope, the fleshy inside is used in food, and the coconut water is a delicious drink, especially when it’s hot outside. And the oil that you put in your hair? That comes from the coconut too. Kappalandi Common name: Peanut Scientists call me: Arachis hypogaea All plants love soil, but peanuts love the earth so much that they grow underground. And that’s why some people call them groundnuts. These little seeds are packed with goodness and are delicious when eaten raw, steamed, or roasted.Choru Common name: Rice Scientists call me: Oryza sativa Rice is one of the most popular grains! It’s eaten in more homes in India than any other seed I know. On the plant, rice actually has a rough, brown cover, like a jacket, which keeps the seed inside safe and sound. Chocolate Common name: Chocolate Scientists call me: Theobroma cacao (which means food of the gods) Rice might be the most popular seed, but cacao is definitely the most loved seed of all — especially by Tooka and Poi. The cacao seed is where chocolate comes from. Each cacao fruit has about  seeds that are roasted and then mixed with sugar and milk to make bars of delightful chocolate."	./Story text files/124.txt	7294	17	5.621523579201935	692	135	218	56.8968253968254	65	61	39	11.238095238095237	54	72	470	357	6	1.431477516059957	839	95
The rains have stopped. But winter is not here yet. This season is called Autumn. It is called Sharat Ritu in Sanskrit. Aksheeee! I have a cold. The change in the weather seems to make so many people ill. Granny says all children will be well before Dasara.There are so many festivals during this season. Manu has plucked leaves from my mango tree to make a 'Toranam' to put on our front door. I think our toranam is the best in the whole world!The sky is so blue now. And there are bright, white clouds that look like cotton balls. Everything seems so calm. Tonight, we are going to celebrate Sharat Poornima. The festival is also called Khojagiri. The full moon will make everything around us look like silver. We will stay awake all night. We will drink hot kheer made of white things like coconut, rice and milk.Meera is celebrating Onam today. It is a festival of joy. Her family has made a beautiful Pookalam, a rangoli using flowers. She says this is the time of the year when the crops have been cut and there is enough grain for everyone. It is a happy time. It is the time when the famous boat races of Kerala are held. What a fun! I feel like celebrating too.Dasara holidays are here. In Tamil Nadu, people love to set up a Navaratri Golu, which is a display of dolls on three to nine steps. During this festive season, Manu and I are going to start learning Indian classical music. I want to play the Mrudangam. Mrudangam! Dham! Dham! Dham! Manu wants to learn to play the flute. And Amma wants to learn to ride the scooter!Deepavali will also come soon. In the dark, moonless night, all the houses will look so pretty when they are lit up with diyas and candles. Some people put electric lights that go on and off! I like to burst crackers too. But our teacher says that crackers are bad for the air.​He says if we don't take care of the water, air and land, then the seasons will all change after some years. I wonder how that will happen! It is getting colder. This season just after Sharat Ritu is called Hemant Ritu in Sanskrit, says granny. It is a short season in India. Winter will be here soon. ​ ​	./Story text files/318.txt	2119	17	5.685185185185185	178	38	108	42.265306122448976	31	18	23	9.061224489795919	29	20	140	76	4	1.3696498054474708	229	28

Manu looked out of the doorway from his bed. The sun had already risen. He should have got up earlier but last night they had gone to sleep very late. It had been firing day, and firing day meant hard work for everyone in the family. Manu’s grandfather and his father were potters and Manu was going to be one too. It was not an easy craft to learn and you needed very skilled fingers to be able to make a perfect pot. The rainy season, which was a long holiday for potters since they could not do any firing, had just ended and the sky looked clear. This week was going to be very exciting. Today, Manu was going with Dada, his grandfather, to dig clay near the river. And at the end of the week, Baba, his father, had agreed to take him to the city with him to sell the pots at the market.Manu already knew the basics of the art of pottery. When he was a baby, he had been given a lump of clay to play with. At first, he just rolled it about, squeezing it in his tiny hands. When he was about three years old, he was asked to make the lump into a ball. Every afternoon, after they came back from school, Manu and his sister Sushma, who was a year older than him, sat under the shade of an old peepal tree and rolled tiny balls of clay. Some were crooked and would not sit properly in their palms but some came out nicely.Manu loved touching the clay in summer because it felt so cool. In winter, he stayed away from the pile of clay and helped Ma make toys. They made fat men, tall women, dogs, deer, owls and toy carts. The other day, his mother had made a beautiful bell with a clay rope four feet long. Manu heard his mother calling and quickly jumped off the bed, almost bumping his head on a large clay pot full of grain which stood near it. He managed to avoid it just in time. Manu was quite used to bumping into clay pots of all shapes and sizes. Their small hut was filled to the ceiling with earthenware pots, kulladhs or clay teacups, flowerpots and clay bowls for setting yogurt. In one corner sat all the wonderful toys his mother had made. During festivals, people came to their house to buy her little Ganesh and Lakshmi statues.Before Diwali, sacks full of small diyas made by Manu and Sushma were piled up in the hut. ‘Hey, Manu, give us some, ’ his friends would ask, so Manu always made a few extra lamps. It felt good to be able to gift your friends something you had made with your own hands. ‘Not everyone can do it. We potters have special hands that work like magic to make so many wonderful things out of just a lump of clay, ’ Ma said to him and gave him a few toys for his friends. In summer, their hut was cool. On rainy days, the raindrops on the tin roof sounded like machinegun fire. In winter, Baba took the pots out and cleaned them with a fresh coat of geru colours that made them a brownyred. Outside, in the kiln, were many more pots that they did not have space to store.‘As soon as market day is over I will build a new hut for storing the pots. Manu can help me. He is a big boy now, ’ said Baba, smiling at him. Manu felt very proud at being called a big boy! He puffed out his chest and grinned. Manu went out of the hut and, taking a bucket of water, began to wash his face. He chewed a neem twig to clean his teeth. The bitter juice woke him up properly and he rinsed his mouth quickly. The sweet tea made the bitter taste go away as Manu sipped it from a kulladh that smelled of fresh earth. He tore a hot chapatti and dipped it into the liquid before he ate it. ‘Manu, come on, it is getting late, son. We must leave before the sun gets too hot, ’ said Dada. He was wearing a large white turban and carried a spade in his hands.Though he was old, Manu’s grandfather could walk faster than anyone else in their village. People came to him from far away to learn how to make large clay pots to store grain. Only he could make such huge ones and he helped other potters. ‘Here, pile the sacks on the donkey, Manu, ’ he said. ‘Watch out. He may try to kick you like last time, ’ said Sushma, laughing loudly. Manu picked up the sacks and went to the donkey who was chewing grass. They both looked at each other for a minute and then, just when the donkey blinked, Manu quickly threw the sacks on its back.The animal snorted once or twice, shrugged its shoulders and went back to chewing grass. ‘Well done, ’ said Sushma and clapped her hands. Manu and his grandfather set out at once. The sky was a beautiful pink and orange colour and a cool breeze touched their faces. They left the village boundary and began walking towards the river. Many farmers, who were already in their fields watering their crops, called out to them, ‘Off to the river to catch fish, Govindlal? ’ Dada laughed but did not stop to chat with them. Everyone was very busy these days, working all day long and only stopping briefly to have lunch under the shade of a tree.Soon they reached the river bank and Manu ran towards the banyan tree. He looked up, his eyes bright and eager. Yes, it was there. Two round yellow eyes looked down at Manu and a brown head nodded. The spotted owlet was saying ‘Welcome to my river, Manu’. The little boy smiled and went down to the river. Dada had already found a place to dig. They began to dig up the clay. It was not very difficult since it had rained a few days earlier and the earth was soft. Manu dug first with a spade and then he cleared the tiny pebbles away with his hands. He gathered the lumps of clay in one pile. When the pile was large enough, he began filling the sacks.The sun was now high up in the sky and they were feeling quite hot. ‘Come, let us rest for a while, ’ said Dada. They sat down under the banyan tree and opened the bundle of chapattis Manu’s mother had packed for them. They finished eating and then—just as Manu knew he would—Dada said, ‘Aaaai, my old legs are saying something. ’ Manu smiled and began pressing Dada’s legs. ‘Dada, tell me about the river ghost. ’ The old man shut his eyes and began to speak in a soft voice. ‘When I was a child, we had to go very far to fetch clay. In those days, our village did not have proper roads. One day, our donkey sat down and refused to get up. It was getting dark and we did not know what to do. ‘Suddenly a man came up to us. He was carrying a large black clay pot. “I can make your donkey walk but you will have to take me back to the village,” he said, holding the pot on his head. We agreed. Then he said a few words in the donkey’s ears, tapped the clay pot and the donkey got up at once. The man climbed on the donkey’s back, still holding the pot on his head, and we set off.Just when we were about to reach the village, he jumped off and ran into the darkness, tapping the clay pot. The people in the village said he was Bhagwan Viswakarma’s potter who had come to help us. ’ Manu tugged at his grandfather’s toes gently, he knew he liked this. ‘Now, Dada, tell me about the story of Bhagwan Viswakarma’s pot. ’ His grandfather opened one eye and looked at him. ‘You rascal, how many times have I told you the story? You tell it to me this time. I will shut my eyes and listen. ’Manu raised his voice so that the owlet could hear his story too. ‘Once upon a time the devas, gods, and the asuras, demons, decided to churn the ocean of milk. They were looking for nectar. A giant serpent was the rope and a huge turtle was the pivot. After a lot of hard work, many wonderful things began to appear from the ocean: a magical tree, a wishfulfilling cow, a flying horse and finally the nectar. But where was the pot to hold this nectar? Bhagwan Viswakarma quickly came forward and crafted a pot out of clay. From then on, humans learned to make pots. ’Manu thought for a while and said, ‘Our potter’s wheel is one of the first machines made by man that uses the power of motion. ’ Dada lifted his head and looked at him with surprise. ‘Who told you that? ’ Manu laughed and tickled his grandfather’s feet. ‘My teacher in school told us. She also said that the potter’s craft is one of the oldest crafts in the world. They have found many clay toys and pots buried under the ground in the places where people lived thousands of years ago. ’Manu tried to recall the many other things his teacher had told him about potters—how they made the first brick, and how they dug the earth to make a pit. But Dada was getting ready to leave. After loading the sacks on the donkey, they set off. Manu looked at the owlet and it winked at him twice as if to say, ‘Come back soon, there is plenty of clay left on the river bank. ’ The following day, after he got back from school, Manu helped Baba break the now dried clay into small pieces. Later, they would use a big sieve to separate the stones, and then his parents would knead the clay with water.Sometimes Manu and Sushma helped by jumping up and down on the wet clay. Manu liked to stomp on this bed of clay because it made a funny, squidgy sound when his feet sank into it. Once the clay was wellkneaded and his father had prodded it with his fingers a few times to check if it was ready, they moulded it into a few huge lumps and stored it under a damp sack. Every day, Baba and Dada would take a little bit of the lump out and shape it into balls. These would be thrown on the wheel to make pots. In a few quick turns, a beautiful pot would rise on the wheel as if by magic. One second there was just a lump of clay, and then a pot stood in its place! Manu was learning to use the wheel. But so far the pots he had made were not as balanced as the ones his father or grandfather made. His fell down or had long necks that drooped or fat sides that bulged out. Sushma laughed at these funny shapes because she could just twist a bit of clay into a long snake and quickly coil it into a perfect pot. But Manu knew how to shape toy animals and Sushma kept asking him to give her one. He had made a big owl which was in the kiln getting baked. He would give it to Sushma on Diwali but it was a secret now. Sushma had made a toy car for her brother and it too was in the kiln sitting next to the owl. Only Baba, who had loaded the kiln, knew about these little gifts.The kiln was still hot. It would take at least three days for it to cool and then they would break it open. Manu loved the smell of freshly baked pots. It was as good as the fragrance that floated up when the first raindrops fell on the ground. Building the kiln took a long time, and only his father and Dada knew how to do it really well.First, they dug a shallow pit in the ground. They could not fire the pots till the sun had dried them properly and even a little bit of water would make the kiln burst. After checking that all the pots had dried, they stacked them one by one in the pit, carefully placing the dried grass and straw in between. Then they broke some cowdung cakes and covered the pots with them. Finally, the entire pile was covered with wet earth and Baba would ask Manu and Sushma to pat it. ‘You have small hands, you can do it best. ’ Manu and Sushma would pat the earth very gently and carefully. Sushma would run around the kiln singing, ‘Fire our pots, fire our pots well, then fill them with laddoos, puffed rice and jaggery. ’ As soon as the song finished, Ma would bring a metal plate of jaggery from the hut. It was believed to be lucky to have something sweet when the kiln was fired.Once the kiln cooled down, they would take the pots out and then Baba would go to the market to sell them. And this time, he had agreed to take Manu with him! The week passed slowly. Manu could not keep his mind on his studies. All day long he thought about the trip to the big city. His teacher had agreed to let him miss school for a day, on condition that he wrote a description of his trip to share with the class. Finally, the day arrived. Manu and his father loaded the new pots and toys on two donkeys to take them to the bus stop.Everyone in the village knew where they were going as both Manu and Baba were dressed in their best clothes. Baba had tied on a new turban, and Manu was wearing black trousers and a white shirt, just like a city boy. Manu’s uncle, who lived in a nearby village, was also going to the market. He made water troughs for animals. ‘Now they use them in the city gardens to plant flowers, ’ he said, twirling his white moustache and laughing. The bus arrived. It was crowded but they managed to load the pots and baskets of toys on its roof. The bus gave a loud bang, groaned and coughed, and then lurched forward. They were on their way to the big city.Manu watched the fields go by, waving to children playing in villages just like his. When he and Sushma waved to the passengers in a train or bus, he felt very happy when they waved back. The bus reached the outskirts of the city after five long hours. They waited till everyone had got out and then climbed on the roof to get their pots down. Luckily, nothing was broken. Now they had to find two rickshaws to take them to the market.‘You wait here near the pots. I will settle the price with them, ’ said his father. Finally, after much haggling, the rickshaw drivers agreed. ‘All this costs so much—the bus fare, the rickshaws. We hardly have any money left over, ’ said Baba. They went to a big shop in the market which sold all kinds of terracotta things. When the shopkeeper paid them for the pots and toys, Baba did not look too sad. ‘This time the sale is good. All the pots have been sold. Those toys your mother and you made have fetched good money. They want many more, ’ he said. ‘Come, Manu, let us eat something. ’ They found a shop that sold hot milk and jalebis . Manu ate quickly because he was very hungry but he also looked around him all the time.The cars, the lights, the noise of so many people rushing about—it all made his head spin. They walked around a bit and then they saw a mela. The entrance to the fair glittered with bright lights. Manu ran ahead, pulling his father’s hand. There were hundreds of toy shops, unusual games, and stalls of food. In the middle of the fairground stood a giant wheel. Baba gave him some money and he ran to the ticket counter. Soon he was high up in the sky, flying like a bird.It was late when they went back to the bus stop. They were tired but happy. Manu’s father counted the money he had made and smiled. It was not much but he would be able to buy a new wheel that was better than their old one. They had bought a sari for Ma, a new jacket for Dada and clothes for Manu and Sushma. ‘What about you, Baba? ’ Manu asked. ‘I really don’t need anything, ’ his father replied as they sat down in their seats in the bus. The bus would leave only after an hour. But Manu had decided that he was going to buy Baba something. He counted the money he had left. He had only bought the giant wheel ticket and some candyfloss. He still had seven rupees in his pocket. His father had fallen asleep in his seat and did not stir as Manu got off the bus.Manu ran up to a small shop near the bus stop and asked the old man who was dozing in a chair, ‘What can you give for my father for seven rupees? ’ The man smiled and asked, ‘What does your father like? ’ ‘I don’t know. We are potters. We have come from the village to sell our pots and toys. ’ The old man thought for a while and said, ‘Hmm. Let me see. Potters work very hard. But they have magic in their hands. What can we city people give them? They can create anything they want—cups, bowls, toys and even tables. Umm. . . maybe an umbrella. You cannot make an umbrella out of clay. But you have only seven rupees and an umbrella costs sixty. What shall we do? ’ He peered at Manu.‘I have no money but I can do some work. Our bus won’t leave for another hour, ’ said Manu, looking at the umbrella. How nice and big it was. It would keep the sun and rain out. ‘All right, ’ said the old man. ‘Help me put these sacks on that top shelf. ’ Manu jumped up. The sacks were not heavy at all. Carrying clay from the river bank and kneading clay had given him strong arm muscles. In half an hour, he had put all the sacks up on the shelf. Then he helped the shopkeeper gather some paper bags and stacked them in neat piles. ‘You are a strong fellow though you are so small. Here, take your umbrella! Don’t tell anyone I gave it to you or else they will all ask for one. And here are some biscuits for you to eat on the bus. ’ Manu ran back to the bus and hid the umbrella under the seat. The noise woke Baba. ‘What—what is that? Someone must have forgotten the umbrella. I must give it to the driver, ’ he said, getting up from his seat and heading to the door of the bus before Manu could say anything.‘No, it is yours! ’ It was the old shopkeeper who had come to see how Manu’s father liked his new umbrella. ‘Your son, who is a very good, strong boy, earned it for you. Next time you want to sell your pots or toys you can bring them to me. ’ Everyone in the bus heard what Manu had done and looked at the boy. ‘Lucky man to have such a good son, ’ they told Baba, who kept smiling and patting Manu’s head.It was dawn when they reached home. Manu was happy to see his village though he had been away only for a day. He ran to Ma and began telling her all that he had seen. Sushma woke up, and Dada came out. They lit a fire and made tea in a big clay pot which they had made with their own hands. As they sat together, slowly the sky turned pink and orange and another day of making pots out of clay, sunshine and fire began.About the illustrations Madhubani (forest of honey) painting is named after the district of Madhuban, where along with the neighbouring district of Darbhanga, in the Mithila region of Bihar, it is practised. Traditionally, women painted in this style to make floor decorations (aripana) on festive occasions, on paper used to wrap the vermilion (sindur) sent by a bridegroom to his bride, and the walls of the bride’s wedding chamber. Different communities have distinctive styles, but all have motifs drawn from a storyworld of deities, sacred trees, primordial creatures, ritual accessories, epic heroes and heroines, women and men, and symbols of prosperity and fertility and agricultural life. Dastkari Haat Samiti is a large organization of Indian craftspeople, working to improve the social and economic status of people engaged in traditional handicraft skills. Local forms of painting and craftwork have been used to illustrate this series of four stories to encourage the sharing of varied cultural expressions. This work was made possible with the support of UNESCO, New Delhi.	./Story text files/167.txt	18571	15	5.278033794162827	1733	220	262	67.78518518518518	92	178	39	14.322222222222223	58	212	1284	669	5	1.3617511520737327	2006	164
"It’s a big job, it’s number one priority and number two is pretty important too, because you can never ignore nature’s call. So when you gotta go, you gotta go! Some people can do this business inside their houses, some have to go outside. Some pour water after it’s done, others need not. It’s different in different parts of the world, just as it was different at different times in history.Toilets of the past A very long time ago, more than ,  years ago, the people of Indus Valley had beautiful houses with toilets built inside them. People could finish their business in privacy and pour a bucket of water which would flush the waste down a drain. This way, they managed to keep their houses and streets clean.The Indus Valley, situated in present day Pakistan and India, is one of the three oldest civilizations that we know of, the other two being Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. From what we can see of the ruins today, the people of Indus Valley had great building skills, were good at making metal and ceramic products, and planned their citywide drainage systems very elaborately.Around the same time, similar toilet arrangements were present in other parts of the world. Homes in Egypt and Babylonia had toilets built in, and the ruins in Skara Brae in Scotland and the Minoan Crete in the Mediterranean show plenty of pipes leading out of what definitely seems like a toilet inside a house. A little later, about ,  years ago in Rome, people used public toilets. A long slab of stone had keyholeshaped cuts at intervals. People would sit on these openings and do their toilet business while having a friendly chat with the person next to them. I told you it was a “public” toilet!How did they clean themselves, do you wonder? After I tell you, you might wish you had never wondered. They took a long stick that had a sponge attached to one end and dipped the sponge into water, and then used it to wipe their backsides. After they felt clean, they simply handed the stick over to their neighbour, who dipped it in water and used it again. Let me give you a friendly tip here – if you ever find yourself in this place, make sure you pick the very first seat!Not everyone had to poop in public in Rome. If you were superrich, you would have a chamber pot at home into which you would do your business. Once done, you would simply empty the contents onto the street outside. And if someone happened to walk by at the time, well, too bad for them! About  years ago, Queen Elizabeth of England had a toilet constructed inside her house. It had a pipe leading out into a sewage pit outside. But she never used it much because the stench from the sewer filled the toilet and she could not even breathe. So back to the chamber pot she went.Toilets of the present Toilets these days don’t stink. How did they achieve that? In , the English inventor Alexander Cumming figured out a way. Instead of using a straight pipe to connect the toilet to the sewage line, he made it Sshaped. This made sure that while poop and pee and water can go down the drain, no smell can come back up. Have you noticed that a little water always stays in the toilet even after flushing? This is what creates the ""seal"" and prevents the foul smell from entering the room through the drain.Just like olden times, different parts of the world today have different kinds of toilets. Some places don’t have toilets at all. Some toilets are made for sitting, some are made for squatting. Some have a bucket with water for flushing, others have a tank filled with water and a handle that releases the water. Some toilets have paper to wipe the backside, some have a tap or a bucket of water to wash up.There are some toilets that don’t use water at all. Like the ones on a plane. With all the turbulence, you certainly don’t want any water in the toilet bowl! The waste is removed by a powerful vacuum and stored in a tank below. After the plane lands, the waste is disposed of. There are also waterless toilets on the ground. They were designed and built for places without easy access to water, such as remote villages in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. They have been working well, so wouldn’t it be a good idea to have such toilets everywhere? Because the less water we use, and the less sewage we create, the better for the planet, right?Toilets of the future How do you make a waterless toilet? The first step is to make sure that you don’t let the urine and the faeces mix. No it’s not as gross as it sounds – it just needs the pot to be designed in a clever way. Like having a sloping bamboo mat act as a sieve that will allow the waste water to pass through, but can hold the poop and send it to a different pit.Since urine by itself is not harmful (it’s only the bacteria that collect on open urine that cause the smell and the hazard), it can be safely let into the ground or put to use. Here’s how: Hydrogen can be separated from the urine and used to fuel a generator. Urine also has nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium that are great ingredients for fertilizers. Now that urine is taken care of, what do we do with the solid waste? Well, if it is properly mixed with ash and grass, and allowed to rest in a pit, millions of bacteria will break it down into perfectly useful compost for agriculture.These toilets will help us build a world where there is no ""waste. "" Instead it is turned into something of use. If all houses in a city have such toilets, no sewage comes out of them, no expensive sewage treatment plants are necessary and no sewage will flow through the drains into lakes and rivers! What a great future for everyone!On pg  is a board game. You’ll need a few friends to play with and a die.

It was a beautiful summer day in the ForestByTheSea in the glorious land of Somewheristan. Whales danced in the waves, singing to each other. Sea lions, their smooth brown bodies glistening in the sun, played peekaboo with the noisy seagulls, barking and scolding. Every creature in the Forest was happy, happy, happy.Excuse me! you say. That can’t be true. There’s NEVER a time when EVERY creature ANYwhere is happy, happy, happy. Hmmm. Maybe you’re right. Maybe not EVERY creature was happy. This journalist bear, for instance. In this picture, Bear is trying to smile, but he has a great sorrow. He simply cannot find a ‘BREAKING NEWS’ story. He even sent Bird to look  because Bird moves faster and sees better  but Bird came back with nothing.‘BREAKING NEWS’ stories are about anger and fear and hate and greed, and there was none of that in the Forest. Everything was happy, happy, happy. A journalist bear without a ‘BREAKING NEWS’ story doesn’t deserve to be a journalist bear, thought Bear sadly to himself. He should be a Waiter Bear, or a Sweeper Bear, or a Telephone Voice Bear, saying, ‘Please check the number you have dialled’, or ‘Kindly wait  you are in a queue’.He packed his things and started walking to the busstop, when Singing Sardarji popped out from behind a tree.“Arrey oh Journalist Bear!” said Sardarji. “Going somewhere?” “Don’t call me that or I will cry,” said Bear, and told Sardarji he was leaving to become a Telephone Voice Bear. “Don’t be such a silly bear, Bear!” scolded Sardarji. He pulled out a guitar and began to sing. “If Tweety birds stop tweeting, and Hooty Owls stop hooting, the world would be a sad playyyyce, don’t you see?”“Don’t you seeeeeeee?” sang the Tweety Birds and the Hooty Owls. “If Singing Sardarjis don’t, and Journalist Bears won’t, the world would be a bad playyyyyce, don’t you see?” sang Sardarji.“I do enjoy being a Journalist Bear,” Bear said sadly. “I do love finding out things, and talking to people, and writing their stories, but I also do NOT have a ‘BREAKING NEWS’ story, which means. . .” ‘AHA! ’ said Singing Sardarji. “What?” said Bear, puzzled. “You like finding out things! And talking to people! And writing their stories! You are a Journalist Bear, Bear, but you have the soul of a. . . drumroll please. . . Writer Bear!”Bear beamed. Sardarji was right! He really WAS a Writer Bear. “Tell you what, Bear,” Sardarji went on, “let’s travel the world, you and I. I will sing, and you, Bear, will write. Not 'BREAKING NEWS' stories  no one remembers those after three days, anyway  but real stories of real people, stories that will never grow old.” “Hurray!” said Bear.And that was how Writer Bear and Singing Sardarji set out to explore the world. Everywhere they went, Sardarji sang to the people, and Bear listened to them. Over time, Bear wrote many, many stories. Happy stories that made people cry, funny stories that made them think, sad stories that made them hope, and scary stories that made them laugh. And Storyweavers all over the world picked up the long, strong, shining threads of Bear's stories, and wove them into new and wonderful stories for all of us to enjoy.	./Story text files/302.txt	3159	17	5.994100294985251	272	67	167	48.375	41	23	33	9.59375	37	27	179	160	5	1.3884711779448622	361	38

Once upon a time, a traveller fell from the sky.It landed on a field of tomatoes. Kamala and her Thatha ran out. All their tomatoes were crushed, leaving only a shoe.Kamala picked up the shoe. It put out a claw and scratched her. HISSSSS. “Shoo cat!” Kamala yelled. The shoecat yawned.Kamala picked up the shoecat and took it to the goat shed. She gave it a bowl of milk. The shoecat sniffed it and spat in disgust. Thoo! Then it ate up all the goats’ grass. After that, the shoecat went wherever Kamala went.At school, it scratched Shamim Miss. “Shoo! Cat!” she yelled at it. The shoecat spat at her. It scratched all Kamala’s classmates. Where the shoecat scratched, the wounds glowed green.The shoecat scratched the newspaper man. It scratched seventeen goats, thirteen hens, three dogs, and one Thatha. It scratched everyone except Kamala, because it had already scratched her. “Ow! Shoo cat!” they all yelled in Kannada and English, Tamil and Urdu and Telugu, Goatish and Doggo and Chickenam. The cat replied, “Thooo!”The school put up a sign: NO CATSThe shop put up a sign, too: CATS NOT ALLOWEDEven the playground got a sign: CATS STAY OUTKamala and the shoecat went home, sadly. They found Thatha putting up his own sign: CAT GO BACKThat night, Kamala and the shoecat climbed up to the roof to watch the skies. The moon glowed green and warm. The shoecat turned its head up and yowled, “Owoooo!”In the goat shed, seventeen goats turned their heads up and howled: Owoooo! In his bedroom, Thatha sat up and put on his glasses. Sleepily, he said, “Owoo?”Across the village, Kamala’s teacher, her classmates, the newspaper man, thirteen hens, and three dogs lifted their faces to the green moon and howled: “Owoooo!” On the roof, Kamala bellowed: “OWOOO!”With a flash of lightning, it began to rain. The nocat signs melted away.Then the thunder started, BADUM DUMDUM! Every piece of glass in the village broke. PUTT! went the light bulbs. PopPOP went the pickle jars. Mirrors CRACKED and crumbled. Windows slammed against walls and smashed glass flew everywhere, even on the roof.Kamala hid under her bed.The next morning, Kamala crawled out from under her bed. Thatha was sitting on the steps. He was eating a furry green tomato. “Wonderful! Thank your thoocat,” Thatha said. “What a good shoecat!”In the field were lots of tall tomato plants, some mediumsized goats, and one short shoecat.“Thoo!” said the shoecat, in a friendly way. “Thoo!” Kamala agreed as she bit into a green tomato.	./Story text files/537.txt	2493	15	6.220532319391635	202	61	163	39.885245901639344	45	16	31	7.901639344262295	38	23	112	151	5	1.4664536741214058	273	40
"Kavita was upset. She had just found out that her best friend Riya, had been born in a hospital, from her mama's tummy. Just like all her other friends. Kavita wondered why she was not born from her mama's tummy like them. Kavita had come from a Children's HomeNani knew why her grand daughter was sad. To cheer her up, she had made Kavita's favourite ladoos. 'Kavita! Come and have some besan ladoos! ' she called. 'No! ' Kavita pushed the plate away. She was not in the mood.'Alright then, ' said Nani 'Let me tell you a story. ' 'No Nani! ' Kavita refused again. But Nani insisted and drew Kavita near. A story could do magic. And Nani had just the right story to make Kavita smile again.'Many years ago, ' began Nani, 'there lived a wise and kind king called Janak, who ruled the Kingdom of Videha. The people of Videha were happy to have a good and just king like him.Now kings did not usually join farmers in tilling the land but Janak was no ordinary king. He went into the fields one day and began to plough. Driving his plough into the soft rich soil, Janak was alarmed when he suddenly heard a baby.In a furrow on the ground, Janak found a beautiful little baby girl. Janak lifted her up in his arms and the baby gurgled. She had lovely large eyes and instantly smiled at him. Janak's heart was filled with joy. She was the most beautiful baby he had seen. ""I take this little girl as my daughter! "" he announced holding her up.""What? "" cried an old man in the crowd that had gathered around the King. ""How can this be? "" ""What is the matter? "" Janak asked, turning around. The old man remained silent. ""Do not hesitate. Speak! "" ordered the King. ""I was only saying that the child is not born to King Janak and Queen Sunaina. How then can she be their daughter? "" the old man said softly. ""How dare you speak to the King like that? "" the King's guard interrupted. ""No! Don't stop him, "" said Janak. ""I must find an answer to the man's question. ""Finding himself a place to sit under the shade of a Peepal Tree, Janak thought about what the old man had said. He wondered how this little girl that he had found in the furrow on the ground, could be his daughter when she had not been born to Queen Sunaina and him. As he searched for an answer in his mind, the answer emerged from somewhere else.The little baby in his arms, tapped his nose pulling him out from his thoughts. He looked into her beautiful eyes and smiled. ""A father, "" he said as he tickled the little one's toes to make her laugh, ""is made from the heart! """"That's it! "" remarked the wise king. ""I have found the answer to your question, "" he said turning to the old man. ""Fatherhood is born not from the seed, but from the heart! "" said Janak. ""This baby has won my heart. I take her to be my daughter with all my heart. And that is what matters, "" the King added looking up at the heavens in gratitude.""From this day on, the child will be known as Janaki, the daughter of Janak"" the wise King said, looking down at the infant gurgling in his arms. The people of Videha cheered. They were happy that their King had been blessed with a beautiful daughter. The world knows that little girl as Sita. 'Finishing the story, Nani turned to Kavita and gave her a hug. 'So, Sita was not born from her mother's tummy? ' Kavita asked wideeyed. 'No! ' replied Nani. 'She came from a furrow on the ground. In fact the name Sita itself means furrow! ' Kavita knew that the Ramayana was the most enduring epic story of India. That Sita from the epic should be like her, made Kavita smile. Something inside her felt better again.'Ladoos? ' Nani offered Kavita once more. This time, Kavita couldn't refuse and helped herself to her favourite sweets. 'Nani, I've got to go! ' she said after eating a plateful of ladoos. 'Where are you going? ' Nani asked. 'To meet Riya! ' replied Kavita. 'I have to tell Riya and all my friends the story of Sita, ' she said, getting up to leave. 'Sita, the child from the furrow! ' Kavita added looking back at Nani with a confident smile.Sita, the heroine of the Ramayana, the great Indian epic, was found in a furrow by her father, King Janak. The name Sita, is derived from the Sanskrit word seeta which means furrow. Sita is known by many other names. Popular among them is Janaki, the daughter of Janak and Vaidehi, the princess of Videha. Loved by the people of Mithila, the capital of the kingdom, Sita is also known as Mythili. Born from the earth, she is known also as Bhumija. The tale of Sita from the Ramayana, has endured through the ages. Through classical music, folk songs and dance, Sita continues to live on in Indian culture and remains one of the most popular characters of Indian mythology. Sita, is one amongst the dozens of characters from Indian mythology, who is adopted."	./Story text files/396.txt	4791	15	5.420743639921722	435	76	158	48.402061855670105	57	40	32	10.237113402061855	46	51	305	206	4	1.4256756756756757	513	79

' he sang louder. The sun’s rays dimmed a little in alarm. 'Gaaaaaa…. ' he yelled even louder. Beyasura was feeling happy now. So he decided to do some Kathak dance. """" 'Dhadhindhindha, ' Beyasura kept time, stamped his feet and twirled. Feeling more and more happy, he sang along, 'Maaaaaa… Paaaaa…. ' The mountain, which had been sleeping in peace, woke up, all frightened. The asura’s singing and dancing made the mountain tremble. KABOOM! Fell the rocks. DHADAAAAM! The rocks shook the Earth. """"Do you know what happened when the rocks fell? "" Apu asks his audience. Dida shakes her head, with a naughty smile. ""I will tell you what happened, "" Apu says. ""The earth shook! As the mountain trembled, everything started moving. Even Beyasura, a gigantic giant, swayed from side to side! "" ""The earth swung this way…"" says Apu, rolling on the floor. ""Then it swung the other way. "" Apu rolls some more.Just then, the earth actually starts to move! The bed shakes just like the mountain in Beyasura’s story. ""Apu, stop singing! "" yells Pia. ""You are frightening the mountain. "" ""It’s not me, "" says Apu. ""The whole room is shaking. ""Dida, Apu and Pia fall silent. Even Bholu doesn’t bark. Then, there is another bigger jolt. ""The floor is shaking! "" yells Apu. ""It’s all Beyasura’s fault! "" cries Pia. ""No, no, "" says Dida, calmly. ""It is an earthquake. """"There’s no time to run outside. Quick, go under the bed, "" says Dida. They all sit under Dida’s tall bed and hold on to its legs. But the earth continues to shake.TUMBLE! The dolls on the shelf shake and fall. SPLASH SPLASH! The water in the jug starts splashing around. ""Whoooa! "" Apu yells as he feels the floor shake. ""Aaaaoooo! "" whimpers Bholu. Apu’s stomach feels like Beyasura is stomping inside it.Finally, the shaking stops. Dida waits for two minutes to see if it starts again. But now the earth is firm. It has stopped quaking! They all crawl out from under the bed. ""We can go outside now, "" says Dida.""Shouldn’t we have run out? "" asks Apu. ""Only if you are near an exit, "" says Dida. ""If you are upstairs and in a strong building, you should go under the bed or a sturdy table and hold on so it does not move away from you. If there is nothing, go to a corner of the room and stay away from windows, doors and anything that can fall like light bulbs and fans. ""Apu, Dida, Pia, and Bholu go out of their house. Some of the flower pots have fallen and are smashed. A crack has appeared on the outside wall of their house. People are standing on the road, talking to each other. Is it safe to go back indoors?Apu picks up a fallen plant. He puts his hand on the earth. ""Beyasura will sing softly next time, "" he promises the earth.Did Beyasura really make the earth shake with his singing? No, earthquakes have been occurring ever since the earth was formed, even when it was a really young planet. The top layer of the earth, the one that we can see, is called the crust. Underneath it is another layer called the mantle. Then there is the inner and outer core. The crust is made up of tectonic plates that glide over the mantle, and move very slowly and rub against each other. Sometimes, the plates get caught against each other. Then the plates are not able to slide as they usually do and tension builds up. When the plates suddenly move away, energy waves are released. This makes the earth quake as the waves travel through the ground. And that’s how an earthquake happens! The spot where the plates move apart is called the focus. The place on the earth right above the focus is called the epicenter.Layers of the Earth The layers mentioned here are shown in the picture on the left. . Crust . Mantle . Core Earthquakes are measured on a scale called the Richter Scale that ranges from  (small, very less damage),  (moderate),  (very severe). The instrument that measures earthquakes is called a seismograph (shown as  in the picture).Where in India and the world can earthquakes happen? The tectonic plates run under the surface of the earth throughout the globe and have been mapped by scientists. In India, the most earthquakeprone areas are Kashmir, the middle and central Himalayas, the northeastern states, parts of Bihar and the Rann of Kutch. Places like Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Maharashtra, Andaman and Nicobar Islands also get earthquakes often. More earthquakes happen here because the Indian land mass is moving and pushing against Asia. Places where earthquakes strike often are called high seismic zones (shown on pg ). Some other places around the world that have seen devastating earthquakes are Japan, Indonesia, Italy, Turkey, Chile, Alaska and California in the United States.What to do if you are in an earthquake . Don’t panic. . If you are indoors and in a high rise building or a building that is strong, drop to the ground and take cover under a bed or a sturdy table, and hold on. Stay away from objects that can break away from the walls and fall on you. Do not go near a door unless it is very strong. . If you are near an exit or in an old, unsteady building, move out quickly and calmly. . If you are outside during the earthquake, find an open spot away from buildings, streetlights and walls, and stay there. . If you are on a steep hillside, move away from the side of the hill in case of landslides and falling rocks."	./Story text files/494.txt	5820	16	5.648	506	119	161	47.91596638655462	72	47	34	9.873949579831933	55	64	359	266	4	1.3676268861454046	651	78

Bani is a little girl of four. She lives in a house with a green door. She goes to a school with bright yellow windows and red doors.Bani loves her school. Along with lessons, she dances, sings and plays with her friends.One night, Bani was really tired. As she closed her eyes to sleep, she felt herself floating away, out of the house, down the hill into a grove of trees.Wake up! Wake up Bani! Bani woke up with a start. She saw many strange children with funny faces and hats standing in front of her.The children made a ring around Bani and began singing. “Welcome! Welcome! We have waited for you for nearly a year.” “For a whole year!” whispered Bani. “Yes! Yes!” they shouted.“We know you can float in your sleep.” “May be sing in your sleep.” “But I am not asleep,” said Bani pinching herself, “Ouch!” “Even fly in your sleep,” they sang. “Fly? How and where?” asked Bani. “Stretch your arms out like wings, fly like a bird, a cloud or anything.”Bani stretched out her arms and she was flying with her new friends. They flew over the forest and when Bani looked down, she saw hundreds of lights.She followed the children down towards the lights. Bani saw a town all made of giant mushrooms. There were green mushrooms, yellow, white, purple and red mushrooms. In each mushroom was a house.Bani flew into one house. The house was like any other house, but the floors were mushroom floors – so – so – soft. Softer than any carpet. The children skipped and ran showing Bani the mushroom town.“Come ! Let us eat,” said the children together. All Bani could see were fields and fields of odd looking mushrooms. “What funny mushrooms,” said Bani. “Oh ! those are laddoo mushrooms.” Bani was surprised to see that on top of each mushroom was a laddoo. There were yellow, green and white laddoos and barfis too.Bani broke off one laddoo and ate it. It was so. . . o. . . delicious. Quite laddoo–licious, she thought. Bani heard her name being called. She saw mushrooms shaped like books. The pages were turning by themselves. The figures on these pages were jumping up and down, “Bani come read with us.”Bani went to the book mushrooms. The figures told her stories of kings, queens, fairies and brave warriors. She listened while eating mushroom chips. Soon she was very thirsty. The children took her to a stream of sparkling water. It was lemonade. The next stream was orange juice and another mango juice. Bani drank a little from all the streams. It was nice and cold.There was wonderful music coming from the music mushrooms. Bani found herself dancing with a little boy in a pointed hat and pointed shoes. “What is your name?” asked Bani. “I am Pointy,” said he. Even his face was pointed. Then Bani danced with a little girl who wore a heartshaped hat and shoes to match her heartshaped face. “I am Little Heart,” she sang.Bani sang and danced with all the children. “I am tired,” said Bani, “Can we rest?” “No time! No time! Take a sip of lemonade.” Bani took a sip and she felt better. “Let us fly to the mountains,” they said. They flew past mountains made of cake, ice cream and candy.Then they came to the very last mountain. It was a toy mountain. Bani had never seen so many toys! The children played with brightly coloured magic balls that bounced here and there making the children jump. Toy cars whizzed up to them and took them for rides.There were magic jigsaw puzzles that spoke, “Put us together!” Coloured blocks shouted, “Build us up and you can knock us down.” Bani had a great time. Now it was time to go home. They all flew over the forest to Bani’s home.“Bye bye Bani! Come again!” The children flew back to mushroom town.Bani got into her bed and fell fast asleep. In the morning she thought she had such a lovely dream, till she opened her hand and saw a . . . What do you think Bani saw in her hand? Why don't you make your own little story . . . about Bani.	./Story text files/265.txt	3890	15	5.548463356973995	340	83	119	35.36448598130841	79	28	25	7.635514018691588	68	39	265	158	4	1.230019493177388	492	21
"“Achoo!” went Monkey. She had a terrible cold. “That was loud. I almost fell off the tree,” said Koel, poking his head through the leaves.“Really?” asked Monkey. “If this is loud, how loud do you think an elephant’s sneeze would be?” “I can only guess,” said Koel. “Maybe as loud as this… . . . Aachoo!”“That’s not loud enough!” said Porcupine. “An elephant’s sneeze is much louder than that!” “AchOO!” He blew out his little cheeks and his pointy nose quivered.“Grunt, grunt,” said Wild Boar. “That’s not loud enough. An elephant’s sneeze must be huge!”And taking a deep breath, she went, “AAchOO, grunt, grunt.”“What’s all this noise?” asked Deer. “Do you know how loud an elephant’s sneeze is?” asked Monkey. “I always sneeze politely,” said Deer with a sniff. “But an elephant must have a huge, disgusting sneeze, like this!. . . AAACHoo! . . . AAACHoo! Excuse me.”“AAACHoo!”All the animals jumped. Wild Buffalo joined the group. “That’s an elephant’s sneeze,” he said proudly. Deer, Wild Boar, Porcupine, Koel and Monkey looked at him with admiration.“Not bad, but not quite!” purred a low voice. Wild Buffalo’s nose quivered. Tiger leaped out from behind the bushes. She threw her head back, opened her mouth wide and gave the loudest sneeze you could ever imagine.She went, “AAACHOO!”Elephant walked into the clearing. “Pardon me,” he said to Tiger, “Do you have a cold too? I have one and I am going to sneeze.”“What?” roared Tiger. “What?” bellowed Wild Buffalo. “What?” barked Deer. “What?” grunted Wild Boar. “What?” squealed Porcupine. “What?” sang Koel. 'Oh wow! ' thought Monkey.“Ah. . . aah. . . AAH. . .” went Elephant. The whole forest waited. ‘Here it comes, ’ thought Monkey.“Aah. . . aaah. . . aaah. . . aaah. . . aaaaah. . . Aah. . . AAH. . . """"…hrrmmp!”“That felt good!” said Elephant. “Nothing like a sneeze to clear out the trunk.” Then he looked around and wondered, ‘Where have all the others gone? ’Koel began to laugh. “Now do you know how big an elephant’s sneeze is?” he asked Monkey. “Yes,” said Monkey “but. . .” “Not another question!” wailed Koel and flew hurriedly away."	./Story text files/73.txt	2105	18	5.569288389513108	221	46	98	17.803571428571427	102	10	19	4.223214285714286	97	15	133	134	4	1.0513513513513513	342	28
"Tullu and Bullu were twin rabbits who lived in a jungle. The jungle was full of wild animals. But Tullu and Bullu had built a sturdy house for themselves and they lived in it safely and happily. One cold winter evening, the twins were warming themselves by a fire they had lit, when someone knocked at their door. It was a big wolf!""I am dying of cold! "" said the wolf loudly. ""Please open your door a little so I can just warm my tail. I won't harm you. I promise. "" Tullu and Bullu were kindhearted rabbits. They opened the door a little and the wolf pushed in his tail.After two minutes he said, “Aaah! If only I could warm my hind legs too! Please open your door a little more. I promise I won’t hurt you.”Tullu opened the door a little wider while Bullu put a big pan of water on the fire. After five minutes the wolf said, ""You are so kind! Now if you opened your door a little more, I could warm my front legs too. Don't worry! I'm harmless. ""The twins looked at the pan of water on the fire. The water was getting hot. They opened the door a little wider. Now just the wolf’s nose was outside the door. After ten minutes the wolf said, “I feel so nice and warm! Only my nose is still cold. Kind rabbits, please open your door a little more. Don’t be scared of me. I’m harmless.”Tullu opened the door a little wider while Bullu picked up the pan of boiling water. “You can warm your nose,” said Tullu.The wolf wriggled in completely, turned around and sprang at the rabbits. But they were ready for him. Bullu threw the boiling water straight at the wicked wolf!“Aiyaiyai!” he howled as he ran out of the door. “I’ll be back!” he yelled. “And then I’ll tear you to pieces!”Tullu and Bullu climbed up onto the roof of their house and hid there.Soon the wolf came back and brought ten other wolves with him. They broke open the door of the house. It was empty.“There they are!” shouted a wolf who had gone outside. “If we make a ladder, we can reach them.”The wolves began to stand one on top of the other, with the scalded wolf at the bottom of the ladder. They had almost reached the roof when Tullu shouted, “Watch out! Here comes more boiling water!”The scalded wolf was terrified. “No! No!” he yelled. “Not again!”He ran away to save himself. The ladder collapsed and all the wolves came tumbling down!Groaning and grumbling, they limped away and never returned. Tullu and Bullu came down from the roof, repaired their broken door and lived happily ever after."	./Story text files/476.txt	2470	16	5.492481203007519	233	33	118	40.18333333333333	39	21	22	8.65	34	26	167	99	4	1.3081967213114754	286	19

A jackal and a rabbit were the best of friends. One day the jackal’s wife was not feeling well. The jackal called the rabbit and said, “My wife has fever. She does not feel like eating anything. Now she says she could eat a crab.”The rabbit said, “Let us go and get a crab for her.” Both the friends set off to find a crab. The rabbit went in one direction and the jackal in another.The rabbit soon spotted a hole in the mud. He peeped in and saw a fat crab sitting inside. ‘This will be perfect, ’ thought the rabbit.He carefully put his hand in the hole which was quite deep. When his hand could not reach the crab, the rabbit put his tail into the hole.The crab bit his tail hard and held it tight. The poor rabbit cried loudly. The jackal heard him and came running to him. The rabbit gasped, “Don’t just look at me. My tail is caught inside, pull me out.”The jackal caught him by the ears and pulled with all his might. When he saw the tail move, the crab bit the rabbit’s tail again. The rabbit yelled in pain and jumped.His tail got cut and was left behind in the hole. His ears had become very, very long after the jackal had pulled them.Since that day the rabbit’s tail is short and his ears long.The Partners IgnusERG is a guild of resource persons working to support teachers and enhancing the quality of education, particularly in government schools.

Tomorrow is my birthday, A day of special fun I want the stars to wish me The moon too, and the sun.I wake up in the morning And look at what I see! A rocket waiting outside; I try and hide my glee. The rocket is all fired up, My bags are packed and full. 'Whoosh! ' it roars and shoots up, I’m Astronaut Madam Gul! My cat, she shakes and trembles, My head spins round and round. In just a few minutes, We are way above the ground.Six hours later, here it is My new home in outer space They call it Space Station; Hello, you beautiful place!Boing! we go from step to step, I hardly feel my legs. Before we even know it, We turn down on our heads! And then begins the floating, To the left and to the right. Drifting through the air we go, And twisting to the side.Oops! My bag turns upside down And out come two jalebis. Samosas that I packed so well, I think they’ve all gone crazy! They bump around and float across, The crumbs and icky juice. I'll stick to labelled packets, Of these special space foods.My hair is all so sticky, The clothes are such a mess. My cat, she tries to lick me clean; A bath will work the best. But here’s a little secret, There are no taps in space. I wet this towel just a bit And wipe it on my face. Then squeeze some shampoo in my hair And rub it through and through. A final proper wiping, My hair looks clean and new.I get into my space suit For a very special day. Come and join me in the fun, It’s space walk all the way! Step by step I go outside, A slow and dangerous crawl. It’s dark and cold and quiet, I’m connected to the walls. The stars are shining clear and bright They look so big and near. The moon just smiles and seems to say 'Happy Birthday, Gul dear. 'It’s time for me to head back in And get some cosy rest. The space walk was so tiring; That was scary, but the best.This is where I need to sleep, My bed for next few days. What fun it is to squeeze right in And strap myself in place. I wake up after some time, No minute we can waste But first I go and brush my teeth And swallow all the paste!I want to speak to Ammi, My laptop's strapped in place. 'Hello, who’s that? ' she screams from there, 'I’m Gul from outer space! ' I tell her of the things I’ve done, Of magic that is space. Of how the earth looks far from here, Of this Station’s funny ways.I live in space for two full months, It’s time to head back soon. Far away we hear some child Wish for journeys to the moon. Raise your hand if that is you And keep your bags all checked. My cat and I return tonight, It’ll soon be your turn next.Did You Know?  You need to sit inside a rocket to go into space. There are different kinds of rockets, but the most common one is the kind that Gul and her cat go in. The rocket takes them to the International Space Station (ISS), which is Gul’s home in space for two months. They use a spacecraft called Soyuz to return to Earth from the ISS.  There are spacecrafts that go from Earth to ISS carrying specially packed food and water, and other things that astronauts need to live there. Gul has to be careful with the use of water inside the space station. Every drop is precious. Gul and the other objects inside the ISS float like balloons. Anything that is not strapped down will float because they appear to become weightless in space. This happens because the space station itself and everything inside it are falling very fast towards Earth all the time. It is this falling with speed that makes Gul feel weightless. But if they are falling, why doesn’t everything not crash on to Earth? That’s because our planet is round, and as the ISS and everything inside it falls down, down, down, the Earth’s surface curves away from them and they never reach the ground.  There are no taps inside the ISS because water cannot flow down in a weightless environment. So Gul has to use a special shampoo that does not need to be rinsed off, and she also swallows her toothpaste. If Gul leaves a water bag open by mistake, drops of water will start floating all over the space station and combine to form a big ball of water.	./Story text files/134.txt	4074	13	5.355769230769231	359	57	174	63.682539682539684	11	52	32	13.571428571428571	7	56	266	150	5	1.2595744680851064	445	25
"""Line up class! Let’s go to the park, "" Laila Miss says. All the students hold hands, chattering away. Kavya stands by herself. As they start walking, Laila Miss asks, ""Does anyone know what a caterpillar becomes when it grows up? "" Kavya’s stomach flips. She knows the answer! Should she say something?Kavya and her family have just moved to Bengaluru from her village. They live at the construction site where her parents work. It’s hard living in a halffinished house. The air smells of smoke, and the honking traffic makes it hard to sleep. The towering buildings, zooming cars, and busy people make her feel very, very small.Kavya has been coming to school for a week. She still hasn’t spoken to anyone. What if they make fun of her accent? Or tease her because she’s never been to school before? Kavya takes a deep breath and raises her hand. In a noisy city like Bengaluru, she can’t be quiet forever.""When caterpillars grow up, they become butterflies, "" Kavya says. ""That’s right! "" Laila Miss says. ""Caterpillars are only caterpillars for a few weeks, "" Kavya says. ""They spend that whole time eating leaves. "" ""They must get very big, "" says Mary, her classmate. ""They do! "" ""After they eat and eat and eat, caterpillars weave cocoons on the sides of plants. They go inside, where they grow and change, "" says Kavya.""That’s correct, "" Laila Miss says. ""They stay in the cocoons for about two weeks. When they come out, they are butterflies. "" ""Look, we’re at the park! "" Mary says. Kavya gasps. The park is covered in butterflies!Blue butterflies the colour of rivers. Yellow butterflies the colour of sunlight. Orange butterflies the colour of ripe chikoos. Blackandwhite butterflies the colours of starry skies. These are all the colours Kavya misses from her village. She feels her heart flutter.""Every year, butterflies travel thousands of kilometres to come to this park. They are here formore food, better weather, and a safe place to lay eggs, "" Laila Miss says. ""This journey is called migration. """"Don’t they get tired, flapping their wings for so long? "" a classmate asks. ""If there is a strong wind, they don’t have to flap their wings, "" Kavya says. ""They spread their wings and glide. "" ""That must be bumpy, "" Mary whispers to Kavya.Kavya thinks about the bus ride to Bengaluru – squeezed in between all the luggage. Bumping and tumbling for hours and hours and hours. Is that how a butterfly feels on the wind?""When butterflies migrate, they follow rivers. To stay healthy, they stop along the riverbank to soak up minerals with their feet. It’s called mud puddling, "" Laila Miss says. ""Mudpuddling? "" Mary says. ""That sounds like fun. "" Mary and Kavya smile at each other. ""It is, "" Kavya says. ""But now puddles are hard to find. "" In Kavya’s village, men in trucks take sand away from the river. The weather gets hotter and hotter. There is less and less rain.Last year, the river went dry. The butterflies didn’t have enough water to mudpuddle. Kavya’s family didn’t have enough water to farm. That’s why they moved to Bengaluru.""You know a lot about butterflies, Kavya, "" says Laila Miss. ""That’s because they are my favourite insects, "" says Kavya. ""Why do you love butterflies so much, Kavya? "" asks Mary. How can Kavya choose just one thing? She loves how their bodies are sometimes spotted and sometimes striped. How they drink nectar with their long noses. How they spread pollen, which makes more flowers grow.""They fly far, but wherever they land, they make new friends, "" Kavya says, squeezing Mary’s hand. ""They’re very small, but they’re also very brave. "" ""Just like you, "" Laila Miss says. Kavya smiles a smile as wide as a butterfly’s wings.Make a Butterfly Rest Station Butterflies in India migrate twice a year. Their journey is getting harder and harder because our forests and rivers are disappearing. Butterflies don’t have enough places to rest. Many get tired along the way. One way to help butterflies is to make safe spaces for them to stop and have a good meal.Here’s how to make a butterfly rest station: Find a flat vessel with high edges, like a thali or a plate. Butterflies love bright colours. Paint the vessel red, yellow, or orange. Fill the vessel with butterfly food. It’s easy to make! Mix four cups of water with one cup of sugar.Add pieces of overripe fruit. Butterflies love bananas, guavas, mangoes, papayas, and oranges. Keep the vessel out on your veranda, windowsill, or anywhere outside. Clean and refill the vessel every two to three days. To attract even more butterflies, plant flowers that butterflies love. You can plant verbena, geraniums, dahlias, or sunflowers. You don’t need a lot of space – you can plant them in pots on the ground, or keep them on windowsills."	./Story text files/235.txt	4743	16	5.772556390977444	428	104	104	46.91919191919192	60	39	23	9.282828282828282	46	53	328	204	4	1.392	556	69
Micki and her friends Lolo and Unathi were reading their favourite books. “If you help Micki clean her room,” Prudence said, “you can all have biscuits afterwards.” “YAY!”But they carried on and read and read and read.Then they stopped reading and cleaned Micki’s room.“My room is tidy now,” Micki said. “Let’s go and get biscuits.” But they could not find Prudence anywhere.Micki, Lolo and Unathi stared at the biscuit jar on the top shelf wondering how to reach it.So they found a chair and took turns to climb on it. But none of them could reach the biscuit jar. “My mama would say this is dangerous and we could fall and hurt ourselves,” Lolo said.So Lolo sat on Unathi’s shoulders and stretched out his arms but could not reach the biscuit jar. “My father would say this is dangerous and we could fall and hurt ourselves,” Unathi said.So they found a rope to throw around the biscuit jar and pull it down. But they could still not reach the biscuit jar. “My mummy would say this is dangerous and the jar could fall on us and hurt us,” Micki said.“What are you doing?” Jonathan and Sakhi asked. “We are trying to reach the biscuit jar,” Micki said. “We can help you,” they said.“Let’s push the table close to the shelf and climb on that instead,” Jonathan said. But still, none of them could reach the biscuit jar.“Let’s throw a ball at the jar and knock it down so that the biscuits fall out,” Sakhi said. “Yes!” Lolo and Jonathan said. “No!” Unathi and Micki said.And that is how, together, they reached the biscuit jar! Finally, Micki had an idea…	./Story text files/393.txt	1554	15	5.601156069364162	143	30	96	50.833333333333336	15	15	20	10.266666666666667	13	17	103	70	3	1.3678756476683938	174	19
We have just taken out our winter uniforms for school. It is not so cold yet. Winter is called Shishira Ritu in Sanskrit. I love to eat hot things in this season.Amma took us to the Groundnut Fair yesterday. There were big hills of groundnuts on both sides of the road near the Bull Temple in Bengaluru. Dry nuts, boiled and salted nuts, roasted nuts!Amma says people in Gujarat have a Ponkh festival in winter. Farmers roast bundles of millet on coal stoves. Everyone eats the fresh, green, plump and tender beads of millet grains called ponkh.I wore a bright blue sweater to the fair. There were many stalls all along the road. Manu wanted to go on the merrygoround. I wanted to buy grandma a warm, soft shawl.It is so cold now. I rub my hands together as I walk to school. My new red bangles make a pretty sound! Oh, how nice, I say aloud and I can see a frosty cloud in front of my mouth as I talk!My friend Rajni lives in Shimla. In her grandfather’s village, they pack snow into bamboo baskets to make cone shaped snow heaps on roof tops. Then the children go to take the blessings of all the elders. Rajni also told me about the Snowman Competition.In Srinagar, they say “Nausheen Mubaraq!” when the first snow falls. They wrap some snowflakes in a sheet of paper and send it to a friend. The friend has to throw a feast for you after that!I would love to play in the snow and have a feast of naan and rogan josh too. Rajni says that the trees look lovely when they are covered with snow.Everybody likes to drink hot tea and she likes to drink milk with jaggery. They can't go out without their jackets, caps, gloves and mufflers, but it is fun to throw snowballs at each other, she says!During the next winter holidays I hope I can go to Shimla or to Jaisalmer. In Jaisalmer, there is no snow, only sand. I would like to go to the Desert Fair and ride on camels, watch folk dances and puppet shows, and take part in the turban tying contest!Soon we will be celebrating Sankranti. Janu says her family makes tilgud. Rohan says his family makes yellu. Narsi says he has chigdi during the Sankranti season.Do you know, all these are made with sesame seeds and jaggery! They must be good for our health in the winter. I like winter. I like it when my friends hug me. I like to snuggle in the chair next to Granny and read a book.My tree will never be covered with snow.But I want it to be full of birds and mangoes and squirrels and parrots very soon.	./Story text files/257.txt	2455	14	5.652509652509653	219	40	136	53.577777777777776	26	19	28	11.244444444444444	14	31	142	117	5	1.4068965517241379	261	29
In a small garden in the city, there was a big pipal tree. A family of squirrels lived on that tree. Vikki is one member of that family who likes to talk big. His cousin, Kato had come to visit him from Far Forest.“Today we shall go on a big boat,” said Vikki to Kato. “B. . . B. . . But, I. . . I. . . am afraid of water, I cannot swim,” mumbled Kato. “Come on, you scrappy squirrel! With Vikki around, you need not be afraid. I have been on a boat many times.” Vikki importantly leading the way, they reached the river.The boat was tied to a post. So they ran up the rope, hopped into the boat, and sat curled in a corner.Slowly the boat started moving up and down the river, which curled and curved through the trees. Kato saw many ducks swimming past them. The fish put their heads out of the water and gulped a “Hello!” Some swans majestically glided near them.They were so beautiful that Kato tried to touch one and he toppled over into the river. As he went deeper into the water, he passed some fish. “Help! Help!” he gurgled, as he passed the boat.Vikki did not know what to do. He just scampered from one side of the boat to the other side, shouting, “Help! Squirrel overboard!” A swan had seen Kato fall into the water. She just put her head down in the water and picked up Kato in her beak. Then she tossed him into the boat.A shivering, trembling Kato sat in a sunny corner to dry himself. Vikki sat quietly near him. As he got warm and dry, he cheered up, “What an adventure! Wait till I tell the folks back home.” Already he fancied himself as a sailor! A hero! Brave and adventurous!When the boat reached the bank, the squirrels hopped off and swaggered their way home. Kato was finding it difficult to keep his grand adventure inside his head. His head was going round and round like the boat. He shut his eyes and fell fast asleep at the dinner table.	./Story text files/515.txt	1869	16	5.315270935960591	177	26	95	35.666666666666664	34	17	17	8.019607843137255	27	24	121	82	5	1.2892561983471074	228	14
Diya came home after playtime with her friends. “PAAA!” she called out.Pa ran into the kitchen. He hurriedly picked up a basket of peas and started to shell them.Pa had never gone to school. So Diya had taken it upon herself to teach him. Of all the subjects, Pa enjoyed geography the most. He liked topics related to farming  soil, crops, rainfall, rivers, and maps. (Map of India on pg  not to scale. Artistic representation only. )But today was Math Day.“Pa, you can’t run away from Math,” said Diya. Pa continued to shell peas. “Math is very important, Pa. We’ll be learning division today.”“Diya, I’m busy. Can’t you see?” said Pa. Pa was always ‘busy’ on Math Days. He would suddenly have to clean the house or paint the walls or write letters to distant relatives.“I have to cook dinner,” said Pa. “Okay, Pa. I’ll help you. Give me some pea pods,” said Diya. Pa gave her half the pods.“See, you just did division!” said Diya. She counted the pods. “There were a total of  pods and you divided them into  parts. That’s  each.”“Now, if I divide  pods into  equal parts, I’ll get  in each. Look,” said Diya as she moved the pods into  groups. “So  divided by  is equal to .” “That’s not difficult,” said Pa. “No Pa, it’s not difficult. Remember when Ramu Kaka and you brought back our share of the rice from the owner’s farm?” asked Diya.“We divided the sacks, and each of us got  sacks,” said Pa. “Correct. There were  sacks in all for  families.  divided by  is equal to . And we had  sack left, which we poured equal portions of into  vessels,” said Diya.“So, division is like sharing something?” asked Pa. “Yes! Division is exactly that. We can even share time. In the morning, we have  minutes to use the bathroom.  minutes divided by  is  minutes. So you, Ma, and I each get  minutes. ”“But you take much more than  minutes, and I have to manage with lesser,” frowned Pa. Diya smiled. “Maybe you’re right. But in Math, division is sharing equally.”“We can divide work too. If we have to cook  dishes for dinner, each of us can cook  dish,” said Diya confidently. Diya saw Pa’s face light up. She felt like she had won a battle.“But today I will cook all  dishes,” said Pa, with a mischievous grin. He was hoping to escape the Math exercises that were sure to follow! Diya laughed. “But I want to cook too! What if we divide the work between us?” “So I’ll cook one dish and you cook the other. For the third one, we can divide the work between us. Correct, Teacher?” asked Pa. “Correct, student,” replied Diya.Did You Know? The ancient Egyptians knew to divide, and are likely to have used division in the planning and construction of the pyramids. However, they didn’t use the symbol that we use, which is called the obelus (÷). The first use of the obelus as a symbol for division was first seen in a book called ‘Teutsche Algebra’ by Johann Rahn published in the year .The Chinese used their own version of the abacus called suanpan (or calculating pan) to do division, until calculators became widely available. Scientists say that we end up doing math tasks like division while learning how to play musical instruments such as the guitar or the violin.	./Story text files/128.txt	3166	14	5.689149560117302	271	70	142	40.671052631578945	55	21	29	8.789473684210526	44	32	163	178	5	1.2897196261682242	373	55

Her chosen career is as a professional pilot, she has worked in a variety of aviation capacities from instruction to airline flying, and is the author of several aviation text books. Danielle started writing children's books as a creative outlet from the stress of her 'day job' and as a break from the sometimes monotonous work required for her professional writing. She began with the Mac and Dipper series, aimed at  year olds, inspired by two of her own dogs. After having a child of her own, she suddenly found she had a muse, an eager resource for test reading, and, by benefit of her age, an honest critic all in one. It was fun and rewarding to write creative stories which matched her daughters learning curve and a series of 'junior' books aimed at  year olds followed. Encouraged by friends and family, and already familiar with the selfpublishing route through her nonfiction books, Danielle began publishing the books online so that others could also enjoy them.

Dhoom Dadaka! Dhoom Dadaka! Dhoom Dadaka! Dhoom! High up in the branches of her tree, Dichi plays on her dholak. Her three brothers clamber up the same sturdy tree while their sheep jostle and bleat on the meadow below. “Dichi!” echoes Dada’s voice through the chir, pine, deodar and ash trees. “Come. We must visit your grandmother across the river. Boys, bring the sheep home safely.”“Can’t we come too?” begs Shyam. “Next time,” says Dada firmly. “Dichi will stay on there to nurse Grandma. She is very sick now.”Dada guides their mule through kneedeep river water. Nimble as a mountain goat, Dichi tucks her skirt to skip on the rocks. Her toes tingle in the chill waters, until she slips and tumbles in with a splash. “Careful!” warns Chacha, who is fishing nearby. In a sudden surge, the river swells and roars about them in a furious flash flood. Chacha rushes over to grab Dichi by the arms.Her left leg is caught beneath a rolling boulder. Dada’s figure is a blur – his voice muffled by the raging waters. Caught in the current, the mule swims and staggers to the other side, its burden toppled and swept away. Chacha can barely keep his balance in the deluge, as he tries to extricate Dichi’s leg from below the obstinate rock. Drenched in muddy water, he musters all his strength to yank Dichi out. His powerful shoulders carry her back to Ma who crouches, sobbing over her bedraggled daughter. Sharp needles of pain shoot up Dichi’s left leg. Enveloped by a fit of trembling, she faints.Leaving Dichi with her horrified Ma, Chacha charges back for Dada. But Dada never returns. Cold fingers of fear clutch at Dichi’s heart when they bring his body home from the river. Dichi hears of the sports goods company that felled their chir, pine, deodar and ash trees to make cricket bats and other sports stuff. Why do they chop our forests? Can’t they see the landslides thunder down the mountainside? The fierce flash floods that carry away the poor folk? Those floods took her Dada. . . and the power in Dichi’s left leg. She now has no sensation in it below the knee.Can Dichi ever forget those icy river waters? She still feels them block her ears, leak into her nose, blur her eyes and close over her head.But no. Chacha says she must think of the good things. . . dwell on the positive. Courage wells up with a glowing warmth that melts away her fears. She still has Ma and her brothers. Chacha and Chachi care for all of them. They have no children of their own. Dichi loves her Chacha like her own Dada, but is upset when she overhears Chachi say to Ma, “Your brother is a good man. But his gambling is a habit that can make or break you – and now we’re going downhill. . .” ‘Chacha – a gambler? Oh no! It can’t be so! ’ Days pass. Dichi and her family fall into a new routine.Dichi sits on her ash tree glancing down at the two rugged crutches that lie on the grass below. . . Chacha made them for her from her mighty ash. “My branches are thin and fat, long and short,” whispers her ash, “but I’m strong.” Dichi climbs higher to peer into a bird’s nest. She trails her fingers after a row of ants, and sniffs the cool scent of ash leaves. ‘You’re MY ash tree. Chacha says I’m just like you, sturdy as a yak. With these crutches, I’ll be strong and fierce as a Yeti. ’“Hey Dichi! Everyone’s at the meeting!” yells Shyam. Quick as lightning, Dichi slides down, picks up her crutches and follows him to the vast shady tree where the villagers gather around Gauri, the village elder.“We may be illiterate, but we are wise folk,” says Gauri. “We will not allow them to auction our precious trees to any company. When Chand, the contractor comes with his axemen, we will go out into the forests and hug the chir, pine, deodar and ash trees. There will be no violence.” The villagers troop into the forest chanting their Chipko slogans. Dichi grabs her dholak to boom along with the chant of children who bounce around like rubber balls. Dhoom Dadaka! Dhoom Dadaka! Dhoom Dadaka! Dhoom!“What do these forests bear?” shouts Dichi. “Soil, water and pure air,” chorus the children, following her with a hop and a jump.But a cluster of uniformed axemen is there before them. Contractor Chand’s bulky form looms above, barking out orders to methodically mark the chir, pine, deodar and ash trees for auction with a chalky white X. The villagers clamour around them in fury. They bear down upon the axemen. They brandish their dholaks filling the forest with Chipko songs. “Let us protect and plant the trees, Go awaken the villages and drive away the axemen.”Dhoom Dadaka! Dhoom Dadaka! Dhoom Dadaka! Dhoom!Contractor Chand gives an evil grin as he and his axemen troop into a bus and drive away. The next day, there is a hubbub as the village men get ready for a long drive down the mountainside. Trucks are sent by the government for the menfolk to view the film – a sudden treat that can’t be ignored, as movies are rarely seen in these parts. The women are busy weaving. The village school is abuzz. Children learn new Chipko slogans, draw chir, pine, deodar and ash trees on their slates, beat on their dholaks and dance. “Soil ours, water ours, ours are these forests too, Our forefathers raised these, it is we who must protect these too.” Dhoom Dadaka! Dhoom Dadaka! Dhoom Dadaka! Dhoom!After school, Dichi and her brothers take the sheep into the forest to graze. Along with the other village kids, they hug the chir, pine, deodar and ash trees. Their cheerful voices fade as the sun dips into the horizon and the children head back to the village with bundles of firewood on their heads. Dichi lingers to close her eyes and lean on her favourite tree. Its feathery leaves calm her, the smooth bark cools her cheeks as it seems to whisper to her.‘No one must take away my ash! ’ thinks Dichi firmly. Time stands still. All is right with the world.But these tranquil trees are all aflutter when from their bosom parrots squawk and take wing in a flurry of green feathers. Squirrels burst out of the undergrowth in a frenzy. With a screech of brakes, a bus jolts to a stop beneath the cliff. Spattered with mud, it is enveloped in a cloud of dust. Dichi peers through the curtain of leaves. Men troop out in single file. Their khaki uniforms are scruffy, their axes glint as they head towards her forest with its chir, pine, deodar and ash trees. Burly Chand follows. Their footsteps echo down the mountainside. ‘Help! My ash! They can’t cut my ash! ’ Dichi slips off the branch to slither down the steep mountainside. Panting, she throws her crutches over the gentle slope of green, to roll after them.Rumble, tumble, thump! Rumble tumble thump! Dichi’s heart booms like her dholak. Dhoom Dadaka! Dhoom Dadaka! Dhoom Dadaka! Dhoom! ‘I need help! ’ Dichi flounders, gropes for her crutches and totters home. “Ma!” she gasps. Ma rushes out to wrap protective arms about her as she crumbles like charred wood in a bonfire.“Ma! My ash! The – the – They’re –– cutting it!” “Who, child? Talk slowly. Here – drink this water.” “They c–came in a big bus with axes! So many men. Huge men with sharp axes, Ma!” “Oh no! It’s the contractor’s men come to chop our trees! Quick! We have to do something.” “You wait here. I’ll gather everyone,” says Dichi catching her breath and squaring her shoulders. Women and children rush to rally around with dholaks. “We’ve got to do something. Contractor Chand tricked our menfolk into going away!” Ma says, wringing the edge of her phantu. “How do we stop them without our menfolk?” “We’ll show them! But remember – absolutely no violence,” says the village elder, Gauri who is Ma’s best friend. Dichi’s heart booms along with her dholak.Dhoom Dadaka! Dhoom Dadaka! Dhoom Dadaka! Dhoom! “Chipko!” she yells. “Hug the trees!” holler the women and children till their throats ache for a drink of hot buttered tea.The forest throbs with the wails of chir, pine, deodar and ash trees. “What do the forests bear?” shouts Dichi, raising her fist high. “Soil, water and pure air!” chorus the women and children. The X that marks every tree to be cut, feels like a gash – a wound that will never heal. My Ash! What will I do without you? Dichi’s trembling fingers scratch at the bark to erase the X. “You can’t cut my ash,” she says fiercely, her arms wrapped around her tree. “Move out,” rasps Contractor Chand, pulling her away roughly. Dichi whirls to stamp her feet. Her eagle eyes scrutinize the axemen who crowd around. They look tired and wary. As her gaze fixes on one figure hiding behind a tree, his eyes drop to the ground. Dichi’s eyes widen, “Chacha – you too?”There’s a hush in the woods. Chacha slumps to drop his axe with a clink. “I have a gambling debt. I am out of work. . .” says Chacha lamely. Dichi and her brothers rush to hug him.“Chacha, we’ll work and help you repay your debts! I can weave a shawl and sell it!” says Dichi. “I’ll work at the soap unit,” says Ram. “I’ll work at the water mill!” says Shyam. Chacha’s head droops, a teardrop glistens in his eye. He throws off the shirt of his uniform, picks up Dichi’s dholak. Dhoom Dadaka! Dhoom Dadaka! Dhoom Dadaka! Dhoom!“What do the forests bear?” boom Chacha and Dichi. “Soil, water and pure air!” chorus the women and children.“You foolish girl! These forests bear timber, resin and foreign exchange!” cuts in Contractor Chand. “MEN, chop down those trees at once! Every one of them – chir, pine, deodar and ash!” “No! No! No! Pleeeease don’t!” says Dichi holding on to her tree. “The trees are our saviours!” “She’s right,” says Chacha. “She lost her Dada in that flood.” An axeman opens burning palms to drop his axe. Another axe clinks down and another. . . until one by one the axemen troop out of the forest.Dhoom Dadaka! Dhoom Dadaka! Dhoom Dadaka! Dhoom! “Chipko! Hug the trees!” cries Dichi. Hoarse voices echo with the wind that whines through the chir, pine, deodar and ash trees. “Cut this forest and you’ll wipe out our village,” says Ma. A bulky form blots out the sky. Contractor Chand towers before them, looking like thunder. Shaking an angry fist, he stamps his feet, turns on his heel and marches away.Squeezing her hands together, Dichi takes a deep breath. She can’t believe it – all the axemen have gone! “We did it!” says Ma. “We’ll take our Chipko Movement to every part of India.” “Chipko! Hug the trees!” cry the women and children. Toes tap, feet thump. Hand in hand, they swing into a joyous victory dance. The ash sways in the breeze. Dichi rests her cheek against its cool bark. She feels its feathery leaves rustle in the evening breeze. “I’m like you, strong and fierce like a Yeti. . . sturdy as a yak,” Dichi whispers to her ash tree.Bibliography is a list of published reference material used by an author to write a story.

It is about people.”  Jack Westoby, author of The Purpose of Forests • The Bhotiya tribe live high in the Himalaya mountains of India. They love and protect the forests because they depend on them for firewood, tools and building houses. • In  floods occur in Alaknanda when the forests are cleared, sweeping away houses, bridges, cattle and thousands of people. The Bhotiyas know they have to save their forests so they adopt the Chipko Movement which promotes nonviolence. An illiterate woman, Gaura Devi, a tribal leader from Chamoli District, mobilizes the women of her region to protect their forests. Some consider this an ecofeminist movement where women are actively involved. • In the Alaknanda Valley, Chandi Prasad Bhatt is a humble social worker who teaches the people to embrace the trees and save them from the axemen. Like Mahatma Gandhi, he doesn’t use violence. He encourages tribals to develop their local industries without disturbing the forest wealth. • “Ecology is permanent economy,” says Chipko leader, Sunderlal Bahuguna, who continues the movement to fight the felling of forests.• Like Dichi in this book, a little Bhotiya girl spots the axemen and alerts the village women who march into the forest with shouts of Chipko slogans. Without violence, they block the axemen from cutting the trees. • In , the Government of India passes a law to protect these forests. This is one of the first important environmental movements in India.	./Story text files/339.txt	12675	28	5.746771879483501	1168	226	159	42.262798634812285	196	97	30	8.648464163822526	167	126	591	803	8	1.3639661426844014	1498	156

She raised her voice so that Eryum and his sisters would hear too. ""You could catch a cold, "" she said. ""You don't like pepper soup and you would have to eat some, if you caught a cold, "" she added with a smile.Hoping that they would ask for a story, she said, ""The rainbow is a magical river with healing powers. But it is so high up in the sky that you can't reach it. If you catch a cold, the rainbow can't help you. "" The children thought about this.""Mother, please tell us our rainbow story, "" said Erdoo. ""Yes, please mother, I want to hear it too, "" Udoo chimed in. ""Me three, "" Eryum begged, lifting up three little fingers. ""Well, let me see, mmmm, "" she said playfully. ""Okay lovelies, gather round. Mother, the storyteller is here! ""Erdoo ran for the naha, the stirring stick they used as their totem. She handed it over to mother. Eryum got the headgear for mother to wear. It never failed to put her into character. They all sat quietly to listen to the story they had heard many times. Udoo blew the whistle, telling mother to start. Then the story began.""Once, the rainbow was a magical river. It was hidden inside the green woods of Mbadede. Because it had healing powers, it was guarded. If you were sick, you drank the water. The rainbow was always happy to share. But it didn't like badly behaved people. """"Because of the river's magic, there was ice cream along the banks! Everyone who came to drink the water also enjoyed the ice cream, especially children. The ice cream from the river was red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple and indigo. """"One day, a naughty old woman called Mbom came from the land beyond. On arrival, she met with a guard. He did not know her and he felt a strange feeling. But he did not listen to his feelings. He pointed the way into the woods and told her to respect the river. Mbom agreed and went to the water. """"She took a drink and was healed. Then she looked around to make sure she wasn't being watched. Mbom picked up a stone and threw it in. She watched as it rose, and spread into a ripple. Pleased, she picked up a stick. She threw it in. The same thing happened. """"Mbom jumped right into the water! She hoped to get everlasting life. As soon as she jumped, the river rose up. It shot high into the sky, never to return to Mbadede. But sometimes the rainbow follows after the rain, to feel like a river again. And there my story ends, "" said mother.""So my lovelies tell me, why do you love this story so much? asked mother. ""You often ask me to tell it. "" ""I love it because it reminds me to pay attention to my feelings, "" Udoo smiled. ""It helps me to remember the colours of the rainbow, "" added Erdoo.Eryum tried to push his luck, ""I love it because it reminds me of ice cream! Can I have some now, pleeeaaase? "" ""Mmmm. It's cold now, let's eat ice cream tomorrow. Shall we? "" mother says. Then she adds, ""Next time, I will tell the tale of the end of the rainbow.

Young Dhyan Singh simply loved hockey. As a boy, he and his friends used to cut branches off date palm trees and use them as hockey sticks. Not many know that he actually played for the Army long before he joined the Army. At , he accompanied his father to a match between two Army teams. When one team fell behind in the game, Dhyan told his father loudly that if he only had a hockey stick, he would take them to victory.A British army officer sitting nearby scolded Dhyan for boasting, but then gave him a chance to play. True to his word, Dhyan scored four goals. So impressed was the officer that he inducted Dhyan into the ‘Bachaa Paltan’ or the ‘Children’s Platoon’. The story goes that Dhyan liked to practise the game after his daily soldierly duties were done. But of course, it was usually dark then, and this was many years before the coming of floodlights. So Dhyan used to wait to practice till the moon had risen. On full moon nights, when dogs everywhere howl and the trees are bathed in a silvery glow, you might have seen this slim young man with his flashing hockey stick, propelling a ball rapidly across a playing field before slamming it into the goal.And because Dhyan would wait for the moon, his mates in the Army called him Chand, and the name stuck. Dhyan Chandhe was, polishing his skills in the moonlight. All that hard work paid off for Dhyan. People said he often practised on railway lines, not letting the ball fall off the rail as he ran. That’s probably why Dhyan made a name for himself for his superb ballcontrol in real games; after all, he had learned it the hard way, on the tracks.Time and time again during a game, he would run the whole length of the field, opponents sprawling in his wake, ball stuck like glue to his hockey stick until he sent it smoothly past a helpless goalkeeper into the net. The great runner Milkha Singh once asked Dhyan how he had become so good at his game. Dhyan said he used to hang an empty tyre from the goal, and then hit hundreds of shots every day through the tyre. Dhyan scored heavily, and in the years ahead, he would win plenty of games and medals for India. But what really became his trademark was this incredible skill with his hockey stick, this ability to control the ball as if there was nobody else on the field. As if he was alone again, practising under the full moon. But his stick skills alone would not have made Dhyan a champion. In the team game that hockey is, Dhyan was also the perfect team man. As he ran up the field, in his mind it was like a chessboard. You know how in your classroom, you can tell just where each of your friends sit? You can point them out, often even without looking: “Kavya’s there. Romil’s over there.” That’s what hockey was like for Dhyan. Without looking, he knew exactly where his teammates were, and to which of them he could pass the ball. And those pinpoint passes only made him seem like even more of a magician. Long after he retired, he once explained his beautiful game: “The secret is both my hands, and also my mind and fitness routine.”Talent is one thing, Dhyan meant to say with those words, and he knew he was blessed with hands wonderfully talented for hockey. But like all great sports stars, he also knew that what makes your talent count is the hard work you put in. To play as splendidly for as long as he did, he had to keep his body fit, his mind sharp. Dhyan’s father, Sameshwar Dutt Singh, served in the British Indian Army and played hockey as well.His eldest son, Dhyan, was born in Allahabad in . From a young age, people said of him, he loved the milk sweet ‘rabri’. His mother made the creamy delight for him whenever she got a chance. Did that explain the supple wrists, the thighs like steel springs, that served him so well while playing hockey later in life? Maybe. But like all fond mothers do, she simply fed her growing son well, with no thought of what he might later become.Transferred here and there throughout his career in the Army, Sameshwar Dutt could never ensure a steady education for his children. Only when the Government gave Sameshwar some land to build a house in Jhansi was he able to settle down. But by then, Dhyan had already dropped out of school, after just six years. But though Dhyan wasn’t in school in Jhansi, he took to his father’s game with a passion. By the time he himself officially joined the Army at , Dhyan was already a fine player.By the mids, he was a rising star in Indian hockey. He toured New Zealand with an Army team in those years, helping them win  of their  games. Naturally, he was selected to the Indian team for the  Amsterdam Olympics. The team actually lost their last practice game – Dhyan scored their two goals, but their Bombay opponents replied with three – before leaving for Europe. The loss only spurred them on. They won practice games in England and Europe by such huge margins that when the Games began in midMay, the other teams must have been terrified of this Indian juggernaut.In Amsterdam, India thrashed Austria, Belgium, Denmark and Switzerland. In the final on May , India hammered the Netherlands. Dhyan and his team had sailed through the Olympics without giving up even one goal. Of their  goals, Dhyan scored . A local newspaper put it like this: “This is not a game of hockey, but magic. Dhyan Chand is in fact the magician of hockey.” And everyone who had ever seen the ball stick like glue to Dhyan’s flashing stick knew just what those words meant.India had won the Olympic gold medal in hockey. And the best hockey player in the world, already, was this  yearold Indian wizard. Only three teams played hockey at the  Olympics, in Los Angeles. India beat Japan and the USA, winning gold again.Dhyan’s younger brother Roop was also in the team by then, and together, the remarkable brothers scored  of India’s  goals. This Indian team, an American journalist wrote, was “a typhoon out of the East” . And the storm was just getting started. In their triumphant international tour of , the Indian team played  games and scored  goals. Dhyan fired home  of those. In , it was  games for  goals, Dhyan .And then came the  Berlin Olympics. Germany was then in the early years of Nazi rule, under Adolf Hitler. Hitler believed that Germans were superior in every way to the rest of the world. In the years to come, he would translate that belief into some of the most horrible slaughter mankind has ever known. But in , Hitler saw the Berlin Olympics as his first great chance to show off his twisted ideas to his country and the world.But Hitler’s plan didn’t work very well, and that’s partly because of Dhyan and the Indian hockey team. For the typhoon out of the East hadn’t slowed at all. India brushed aside Hungary, the USA, Japan and France to reach the final. Never mind, thought Hitler, Germany had also reached the final and would show these little brown upstarts from the East their place. And Germany actually scored a goal in the final, which was one goal more than those other four countries, combined, had managed against India. Trouble was, India scored eight. What must Adolf Hitler have thought? What did this debacle do for his notions of German supremacy? Another Olympic gold for India. Many more goals for Dhyan. He was a superstar now, the Roger Federer or Rahul Dravid of his time, celebrated in India and known wherever hockey was played. Yet with all those years of brilliance around the world, Dhyan himself considered his best match to be the final of the  Beighton Cup, an Indian tournament. Playing for his hometown Jhansi Heroes, he sent a long pass to a teammate, Ismail. As Dhyan later said, Ismail “ran with Jesse Owens’ speed half the length of the ground” and then scored the only goal of the match.Always, what mattered most to Dhyan was teamwork. And perhaps his mention of Owens — the great runner whose Berlin medals also proved how twisted Hitler’s ideas were — is an indication of how much the Olympics meant to Dhyan.Dhyan retired from the Army in , as a Major. That year, India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan award. He was then appointed Chief Hockey Coach at the National Institute of Sports in Patiala. He coached there and at various camps around the country for many years. He was delighted that his son Ashok Kumar carried on the family’s tradition of playing hockey.A worldclass hockey player himself who had inherited some of his father’s dazzling skills, Ashok scored the goal that won India the World Cup in . Sadly, by then India was already in decline as a hockey power; that World Cup was almost the last major world title India ever won. The retired Major, with his many memories of glorious hockey triumphs, never came to terms with how India was now struggling to compete with the world in the game he so loved. When India finished a dismal sixth at the  Montreal Olympics, Dhyan lamented, “Kabhi nahin socha tha aisa din dekhna padega,” (I never thought I’d have to see such a day).Dhyan Chand spent his last years in his beloved Jhansi. Residents would often see the great man about town, going to the market or visiting friends or running errands on a sturdy bicycle. He died in hospital in New Delhi on December , . He was cremated, with full military honours, at the Jhansi Heroes ground.Today, we celebrate his birthday, August , as our National Sports Day, and India’s highest award for lifetime achievement in sports, the Dhyan Chand Award, is named after him. If ever India becomes a powerhouse in sports, we can say we owe it to the inspiration of this man. This magician, who once played hockey that thrilled the world. This legend, born under an Indian full moon.Dhyan Chand’s India at the Olympics  Olympics in Amsterdam, The Netherlands IndiaAustria:  IndiaBelgium:  IndiaDenmark:  IndiaSwitzerland:  IndiaNetherlands:   Olympics in Los Angeles, United States of America IndiaJapan:  IndiaUSA:   Olympics, Berlin, Germany IndiaHungary:  IndiaUSA:  IndiaJapan:  IndiaFrance: 	./Story text files/253.txt	9985	18	5.899209486166008	817	195	313	89.78181818181818	24	86	47	17.37272727272727	14	96	487	525	5	1.5180935569285083	983	150
"Fati was a little girl who ran like the wind, who loved to laugh, and who always tried hard to do as she was told.One day, Fati went on a bicycle with her father to the farm to pull some weeds.Soon, Fati was tired. Fati said, “Father, I am hot and tired. May I sit under the mango tree? Father said, “Yes Fati, you may sit there. But, please, do not climb any trees today.”Fati sat under the mango tree. Fati looked up. She saw one. . . two. . . three ripe mangoes!Fati looked over at her father. He was busy and not looking her way. Quietly, Fati started to climb the mango tree. Fati thought, “I will sit on the nice, big branch. It is a good place to rest and to eat plenty of ripe mangoes.” So she sat and ate.After she ate the mangoes, Fati climbed down. . . Only to see another tree. And this tree had something brown dripping down its bark.It was honey! Fati looo ved honey. But she did not love bees. Fati looked up and saw one little bee. Fati thought, “There is only one little bee. He will not hurt me if I climb the tree and look for honey.”Fati looked at her father. He was not looking her way. So Fati climbed up to the top of the tree and took the honey from a deep hole.Fati thought, “I will sit on this nice, big branch. It is a good place to rest and to eat plenty of sweet honey.” So she sat and ate.After she ate the honey, Fati Climbed down the tree. Then she saw the bees. So many of them! BZZZ! BZZZ! BZZZ! She ran away from the bees.Fati ran to her father. Fati was huffing and Fati was puffing. Father said, ” Fati, where have you been?” Fati did not want to say where she had been.So, she said, “ Look, Father, I have a mango. Would you like to eat it?” Father said, “No, thank you, Fati. We must go home now. It's about to rain.”On the way home, Fati sat behind her father on the bicycle. It started to rain.Father went too fast on the bicycle. The bicycle went off the path. CRASH! !The bicycle fell on Fati’s leg.At home, mother and grandmother asked about the day at the farm. ""Fati climbed a tree"" said father. ""Father went too fast on the bicycle and it fell on my leg"" said Fati.""Oh poor, poor Fati"" said mother. ""Poor, poor Fati, "" said grandmother. We must take care of your leg. "" And they did.

Dadu and Muznah love watching clouds. “Did you know that your name comes from the clouds? Muznah means the cloud that carries the rain!” says Dadu.There are so many shapes in the clouds – a cauliflower, a moustache, a crescent moon. Muznah spots a dogshaped one. “It has such a biiiiig nose!”“See that cloud there? I know of an animal that looks just like it,” says Dadu. “Really?” asks Muznah excitedly.“It’s called a whale and it lives in the ocean.” “Tell me more!” says Muznah. “Well, there are many kinds of whales but the size of this cloud makes me think of a blue whale. The blue whale is the biggest animal that has ever lived on Earth, much bigger than a dinosaur and much, much bigger than an elephant,” says Dadu.“Sooooooooooooooo big!” says Muznah. “It’s so big that you would be able to sit inside its heart,” explains Dadu.“Your dog’s nose is floating away,” laughs Dadu. “Maybe the nose doesn’t like the dog anymore,” Muznah giggles. “Arre! It’s floating towards the whale cloud. What will the whale do with a nose? Fish need gills, not a nose to breathe underwater.”“That is true for a fish. But the blue whale is not a fish. It breathes air and so it has a nose,” says Dadu. “It must have the BIGGEST nose in the world! How does it breathe air, if it lives underwater?”“Whales are very special,” explains Dadu. “They breathe at the surface.” “Ooooooo. . . so the whale swims in backstroke?” Muznah asks.“You have a vivid imagination, Muznah!” laughs Dadu. “The whale has a nose on its back!”In fact, says Dadu, the sound of a whale breathing can be heard from far far away. “The whale takes a breath, goes under water, comes out of the water again, and goes PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF. Each breath creates a fountain on top of the whale’s nose.”Muznah gazes at the whalecloud. “The whale with the nose on its back is moving towards us, Dadu!” She lies on her back, her arms tucked in like fins. Waving her arms, Muznah shouts “I’m a whale too. . .. . . PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, hello whale!”Whale Watching! Here are some fun facts about whales: Whales are of many shapes and sizes, and live in all the oceans of the planet. They even breathe out fountains in different shapes and sizes! Scientists who study them can tell different whales apart by observing their breathing.Blue whales don’t have teeth! Instead, they eat very small animals by swallowing a large amount of water and then filtering the animals in their baleen plates. They are mammals, which means they have babies just like we do. Their babies are called calves. The calves swim with their mothers for years to learn all the wisdom needed to live happily in the oceans.Crossing the Line During summer, the whale and her calf move towards the polar regions, where there is more food. In the winter when the water freezes, they move towards the tropics. Whales which live in the Southern hemisphere never cross over to the North. Those that live in the North never cross over to the South. Since the equator is not a real line in the oceans, only the whales know why they do not cross it! Even with all our technology, we still do not know how they do it.	./Story text files/517.txt	3156	45	6.037854889589905	262	55	146	44.7536231884058	43	26	28	9.072463768115941	35	34	182	135	5	1.335978835978836	354	24

Fireflies are small winged insects that glow in the dark but why do they shine and what creates this spark within them? They’re bright and twinkling like little stars! I wish I could have glowed like them but I can’t! Can anyone tell me why?Imagine a dark, moonless night when you have gone camping with your classmates and you lose your way. What would you do? Will you not try contacting your friends by flashing your torchlight?Well, fireflies or ‘lightning bugs’ as they are sometimes called do the same, except that they have an unlimited supply of light within themselves! That is why fireflies never worry about fused light bulbs or electricity tariffs. They seem immensely happy just flying around and glowing this is their signal to say, “Hey, look! I’m here!”The glow of the firefly is produced by a protein called luciferase and a pigment called luciferin. Proteins are special food used by our bodies to create muscles, bones and skin while pigments are natural colouring substances found in plants and animals. When these two meet inside the tiny belly of the firefly, they react with the oxygen already found in there.A celebration takes place, a soft firework display, so to say and bright light is produced which is the ‘glow’ of the firefly! Fireflies therefore are bio luminescent but they are not the only ones. Different types of fish and marine creatures in the sea also produce their own lights!The glow of the firefly functions like a light switch and is periodically turned on and off by the insect. It does this by sending a special ‘message’ from its brain to the ‘light organ’ inside its body that is its abdomen and soon the chemical reaction begins and the glow is produced!The grown up fireflies use their ‘glow’ to call out to their mates. In fact, female fireflies prefer ‘flashy males’ that can blink the longest or at a faster pace. Once they see this special glow, the females respond to it by switching on their own lights. The fireflymates soon meet and baby fireflies get created!The younger fireflies or the larvae, unlike their parents, use their glow mainly to chase predators away. The chemicals within their bodies are toxic and have a horrible taste so creatures that come to feast on them get put off and go hunting elsewhere for tastier munchies!Fireflies are never actually alone! There are more than ,  species of fireflies on this earth. During springtime, especially on dark nights, you may spot a few of them flitting around brightly! Fireflies maybe tiny, smaller than your fingers perhaps, but grouped together, these glowing insects can light up an entire garden and all for free! Sounds incredible, doesn’t it?Amazing facts about fireflies . Fireflies are not flies but beetles! They are often called ‘lightning bugs’ but they aren’t bugs either. . Different species of fireflies glow in different colors that range from yellow to green. Fireflies that flit around in the dark emit a greenish glow while those found outdoors during twilight give out a yellowish light.. There are a few nonvegetarian fireflies that feed on mites and other fireflies! . Adult fireflies aren’t the only ones that glow, their eggs and larvae glow as well! If you tap a firefly’s egg, it flashes in response to your touch. . Fireflies live in all continents except Antarctica. They love tropical climate but also thrive in temperate zones. They flit around forests, meadows and gardens during summer everywhere except in Antarctica that is much too cold for them.Do It Yourself . Find out what else glows in the dark. Both, living and nonliving. . While playing in a group, imagine yourselves as fireflies. Carry a small torch in your hand and make different formations like fireflies.. Make a firefly with trash. For example, with a plastic bottle and glow stick. You can also try your own special ideas.	./Story text files/135.txt	3839	18	6.35068493150685	263	102	179	67.57142857142857	21	35	34	12.642857142857142	19	37	176	189	5	1.6495098039215685	326	82
"Mira could not sit still. The scent of kheer from the kitchen was making her soooo hungry. She loved kheer more than anything else in the world. But when it was finally ready, Papa realised he didn’t have any raisins to put into it.“I’ll quickly go to the market to buy some raisins,” Papa said to Mira. “Don’t eat the kheer yet.” “Yes, Papa,” Mira replied.But when Papa got back home, he saw that not a drop of kheer was left in the pot.“MIRA!” he shouted. “DID YOU EAT THE KHEER?”“No,” Mira replied. “I didn’t eat the kheer, Papa.” “Then who did?” Papa asked. “You won’t believe what happened!” Mira said. “After you left, I saw Kiku was about to eat the kheer. So I had to save it from her! Then Kiku got upset.”“She ran out of the house and into the middle of the road! An auto rickshaw screeched to a halt. ‘OYYYE! ’ shouted the driver. Then a scooter screeched to a halt behind the auto, and a bicyclist slammed her brakes, and a truck honked its horn. ‘OYEEEEE! ’ yelled all the drivers together. ""“Terrified, Kiku ran off again, and I chased after her. We came to a vegetable market. At first, I couldn’t see her anywhere.”“Then I saw her with her mouth stuffed full of spinach. ‘SHOOOO! ’ screamed the vegetable seller, shooing her away.”“Scared, Kiku ran and ran, and I could not find her anywhere! """"Just then, I heard someone scream, ‘AIYYYOOO! There’s a goat eating my flowers! ’ And Kiku came darting down the street, looking frightened.”“‘Kiku! ’ I called, and she ran straight into my arms. I hugged her and brought her home!” Mira finished her story.Papa started laughing. “Mira beta,” he said. “Why are you cooking up stories?” “Huh? I am not!” Mira said. “If you saved the kheer from Kiku, then who ate it?” Papa replied.Mira hadn’t thought about that! Her eyebrows went up. “I don’t know,” she said, scratching her head.Just then, they saw the flash of a monkey’s tail before he jumped out the window. And this time, it was Papa’s eyebrows that went up.“So can we can cook some more kheer, Papa?” Mira asked. Papa laughed. “Yes, my dear. Let’s make some more kheer!”"	./Story text files/410.txt	2086	19	5.766816143497758	181	42	116	33.78333333333333	44	16	23	7.266666666666667	40	20	128	95	3	1.3099630996309963	258	13

"“I’m so tired!” yawned Eli as he stretched to the skies “I need a nap!” he said, rubbing his eyes “Somewhere snuggly to curl up in a ball…” He looked all around, and then began to crawlOut into the garden where he found a leaf pile. He nestled down with a happy smile. But just as he closed his sleepy little eyes. . . Around him buzzed a swarm of flies “Go away! Stop buzzing, I’m trying to nap!” But no they didn’t stop, they went Flap flap flap…Sleepy little Eli crawled back inside, In a dappled corner, a stack of books he spied He climbed on top and rested his head “This is rough. And hard. .” he sleepily said.“Books are only meant to be read. . . They’re just not soft enough to make a bed”Shhh…ever so quietly, Eli nuzzled his fur And Toby the dog, didn’t even stir. But… “Ahhahhh Aaaachooo” , Toby woke with a jolt Off darted the furry pillow, quick as a boltWhere oh where is the best place to doze? Eli thought and thought as he twiddled his toes Somewhere dark and warm, is there such a place? Hmmm, maybe inside Dad’s guitar case…The shape was all wrong, the case way too small “Oh gosh, I really am tired now…” Eli started to bawl Eli was lifted from the floor so high, By a warm pair of hands and a lullabyThree hours later Eli’s eyes open wide. He had fallen asleep, and he hadn’t even tried! He stretched and yawned and he started to clap “I found it! It’s true!

Hyena and Raven were once great friends, even though they were quite different in some ways. Raven could fly but Hyena was only able to walk.One day Hyena, curious to know something about his friend, asked Raven, “What is this white thing which is always below your neck?”Raven answered, “It is the fatty meat which I usually eat in the sky. I have been eating it for so long now it is stuck on my neck.” On hearing about meat, saliva started pouring out of Hyena’s mouth for he was greedy and he loved meat very much. Hyena really wanted to eat that meat. But how could he reach the meat in the sky if he had no wings to fly? “Please my friend,” he asked Raven, “lend me some feathers so that I can make myself some wings. I really want to be able to fly like you.”Raven was not mean, so he gave him some feathers. Hyena sewed them together into wings. He fastened them to his body, and tried to take off into the sky. But he was far too heavy for the few feathers to carry him. So he had to think of another plan.“Please my friend,” he asked Raven, “could I hold onto your tail as you fly up into the sky?” “All right,” said Raven. “I know how much you want to fly. Let’s do it tomorrow morning.” When day came, Hyena took hold of Raven’s tail and Raven flew up into the sky.Raven flew and flew and flew until he was exhausted. But Hyena said, “Just a little further, my friend!” He could see the white and fatty meat just above them, and his mouth was watering.When they reached the first piece of fatty meat, Hyena felt a jerk. One of Raven’s tail feathers came off in his hand! Then there was another jerk, and another.Raven felt much lighter, and the ache in his tail was going. He sang: Raven’s feathers, unpluck yourselves. Raven’s feathers, unpluck yourselves. In response, Hyena sang the opposite: Raven’s feathers hold on, don’t unpluck yourselves. Raven’s feathers hold on, don’t unpluck yourselves.Finally, the feathers could not hold Hyena anymore. He was in the middle of nowhere in the sky. He jumped onto the fatty meat thinking that as he ate, the fatty meat would hold him. But as he tried to hold and eat the ‘meat’, all he felt was moist cloud!By now he was falling fast. “Help, help!” he shouted. But no one could hear him. Raven was lost in the clouds.Hyena fell on the ground with a crash and lay silent for some minutes. He woke up howling in pain, with a broken leg and dark scars all over his body.From that day to now, Hyena limps and he has many scars on his body. He has never been able to fly. And he and Raven are no longer friends.	./Story text files/512.txt	2564	19	5.625482625482626	215	44	129	54.76086956521739	21	25	23	11.5	16	30	151	108	4	1.3344709897610922	275	18
The royal orchard looked lush after the rains. The earth was soft and wet and had a delightful fragrance. The trees looked like they had been washed and each leaf looked like it had been polished by hand. The head gardener was getting a new tree planted. He directed his helpers to a pit that had been prepared just that morning. The young tree was carefully lowered. All along, the head gardener kept saying, “I will lose my job and all of you will rot in the darkest chambers of the palace if this tree does not survive. And if it blooms, you won’t have to work another day in your life. You will all be handsomely rewarded.” As an offering to Mother Earth, he threw in sugar cane juice, before the roots of the young tree were patted with mud. Just then the King and his young prince stepped into the orchard. This was to be the first walk among the trees for the prince with his father. “Father, what is this sapling?” asked the prince, pointing to a plant. “It is a pomegranate sapling. The tree that will have the most beautiful flowers. . .” The prince watched his father admiring the trees around them with love and care.Pomegranate It is hard to say which is more beautiful  a pomegranate fruit or the brilliant red flower. The fruit has a deep red colour and is the size of a cricket ball. It has leathery skin and when it is opened, you find many red, juicy seeds, which look as though they are made of glass. Each seed has a woody, crunchy centre. Some fruits are yellowish pink and have pink seeds. These are also very tasty. The pomegranate tree grows to about three metres. The long and narrow leaves are shiny and the branches have a few thorns. In the spring, the tree is covered with scarlet flowers. The petals look as though they are made of crinkly paper. These flowers have no smell. The petals grow out of a red part called the calyx. After the petals fall, the calyx begins to grow bigger and bigger till it becomes a pomegranate with a crown.Pomegranate juice is very tasty and is taken to bring down fever. Pomegranates contain plenty of natural sugars and vitamin C. The dried seeds are made into sour anardana, which is a spice used to flavour pakoras and aloo paranthas. The rind of the pomegranate is dried and powdered and taken to cure an upset stomach. Pomegranates are called anar in Hindi. One of the most renowned dancers in the court of Mughal emperor Akbar was called Anarkali — bud of the anar — because she was so beautiful. Some pomegranates are called kandhari, as once they were only grown in a place called Kandahar, in Afghanistan.Jackfruit The jackfruit grows on a tall tree with a thick foliage of dark green leaves. The jackfruit does not grow just on the branches like other fruit, but also on the tree trunk. Another amazing fact is that when the jackfruit tree turns very old, the fruit can also grow on those roots which come out above the ground. The large, oblong fruits can sometimes weigh as much as  kilograms. Their rough skins are covered with conical studs. When jackfruits are young they are green and eaten as a vegetable, but when they are ripe and turn yellowishbrown they are eaten as a fruit. The ripe fruit has a strong characteristic smell and not everyone likes it.The seeds of the jackfruit are also very tasty. They can be roasted and eaten. Fried jackfruit makes delicious chips. When sugared and dried, the fruits make excellent candy. The leaves are warmed and used to foment wounds and stop swellings. The wood of this tree is not attacked by termites. An orange dye is made by boiling the wood. This is used to colour the robes of Buddhist monks. When two sticks of the jackfruit tree are rubbed together, fire can be produced. The tree is very ancient and it is mentioned in Sanskrit texts as the panas. It is the largest treeborne fruit in the world. This tree has its origin in India. The fruit is very nutritious, as it has carbohydrates, proteins, some fats and vitamins.Papaya When we cut open a golden orange papaya, we find a lot of shiny, black seeds that look like whole black pepper. Can you imagine how many trees can grow from each fruit — at least ! But not all the trees that grow from the seeds will give us fruit. This is because some trees have flowers that are male and other trees have flowers that are female. When we plant many papaya trees together, it ensures that crosspollination takes place and the ‘female’ trees bear fruit. The fragrance of papaya flowers is very sweet. Insects and birds help in pollination and little papaya fruits begin to form.The tree has big leaves that are thickly veined. When they dry, they fall off leaving a scar on the trunk. The wood of the trunk is not hard. It is soft inside, rather like the stem of a big plant. Papayas are very nutritious, with lots of vitamin C and A, and calcium too. Raw papayas are used as a tasty vegetable. Papayas have an enzyme called papain, which is useful for digestion. Raw papaya helps in tenderizing meat. Ripe papaya pulp is good for skin problems and is used to get rid of spots and blemishes on the skin. Papayas came from Mexico and Central America. But they are seen almost everywhere in India!Banana Some banana trees are as tall as a singlestoreyed house while others are only as tall as a person. The leaves are sometimes oneandahalf metres long and over half a metre broad, with a thick rib running through the centre. The new leaves have a fresh green colour but as they grow older, they become darker and get torn at the edges. The trunk of the banana has no bark. It is actually a thick stem made of the stems of the leaves that are tightly wound around each other. The flowers of the banana tree grow inside a reddish cone. Hundreds of tiny white flowers can be found inside each cone. As many as a hundred bananas can grow together in a bunch. When the bananas are almost ripe, the bunch is cut down and left to ripen.Raw bananas are eaten as a vegetable. Delicious chips can be made from raw bananas. Banana flowers are used to make tasty curries. Monkeys and elephants love bananas. An elephant can eat many bunches by himself! Bananas are nutritious as they have many vitamins such as A, B and C, as well as calcium, which is needed for our bones to grow strong. It is also a good source of minerals like potassium and magnesium. Bananas are considered auspicious by Hindus and are offered during a puja. When there is a wedding or a puja, the trees or bunches of bananas are used to decorate both sides of the entrance to the house. The leaves make wonderful, natural plates. The leaves are also used to make cups.Jamun The jamun tree is tall and graceful, with a greybrown bark and deep green, long oval pointed leaves. The trees always have dense foliage. They grow about  metres tall. Children love to play beneath their deep shade. The bark is smooth but the wood is weak so the trees are not very safe to climb. From March to May, the tree is full of bunches of tiny creamy flowers, which bees and other insects love for their nectar. We all wait for the rains, when the jamun gives delicious, deep purple fruit with a stone in the centre. The ripe fruit is sweetsour and good to eat. Ask any parrot or squirrel, or even fruit bats that come to eat the juicy berries at night! Jamun trees often grow wild in forests and according to Hindu legend, Krishna loved to eat the fruit when he grazed his cows. The dark purple colour of the fruit is supposed to be the same colour as Krishna's complexion. Lord Ganesh is supposed to love this fruit too. The tree is also sacred to Shiva and Vishnu.This tree is originally from India. The name jamun, comes from the word Jambu Dweep, as India was once known in the olden days, since it was supposed to be full of jamun trees! Ripe jamuns are very tasty when they are eaten with rock salt. In the forests when wild jamuns fall from the tree they are eaten by bears, deer, monkeys and other small animals. The bark and seeds of the jamun are dried and powdered and then used as a medicine for diabetes. The fruit is rich in fruit sugar, iron and vitamin C.Guava Guavas are really delicious! Ripe yellow ones are tasty, but the crunchy green ones are mouthwatering too, especially when sprinkled with salt and masala. Have you seen a guava tree? It is not very tall, possibly as tall as a single storeyed house. The trunk is slender with a greyochre bark that peels off in strips. The leaves are oval and rough to touch. The tree is full of beautiful, fivepetalled white flowers, towards the end of winter and then again at the time of the rains. When these flowers fall, small green guavas begin to appear. At first, the fruit is green and hard. As it ripens, it becomes softer and the colour becomes a creamy gold. The flesh is white and in the centre, there are lots of woody seeds. Some guavas have pink flesh. These are also very tasty. Another type of guava is deep red on the outside.Guavas that ripen in the winter are always tastier than those found during the rest of the year. In India, Allahabadi guavas are famous for their taste. There are so many guava trees in India that it is hard to believe that they came from Brazil in South America. Sailors travelling from those parts, brought the seeds of guavas with them. Parrots and monkeys love guavas. It is believed that a guava pecked by a parrot will be sweet! Guavas are very good for us as they are full of vitamin A and C. The tree has other uses too. The leaves are mashed and used to relieve toothache. The bark is used to make a dye for colouring silk.Coconut Graceful coconut trees grow in sandy soil, in the tropics where the weather is warm and wet. Coastal areas have the largest number of coconut trees. This tall tree has a slim trunk, which bends with the strong breeze that blows in coastal areas. Because it bends, it does not break. The water inside green coconuts is very tasty and nutritious. It has sugar, protein, amino acids, and minerals like calcium, iron and copper, and vitamins. As the fruit becomes ripe, it turns brown and hard and the water inside becomes sweeter, until it is quite dry. Coconut oil is extracted from the flesh when the nut turns brown and woody. Each coconut leaf has a long central rib with smaller hard leaves growing on either side. Waving in the breeze, coconut leaves resemble the feathers of some giant bird. The leaves are plaited to make baskets and mats, and also to make thatched roofs. The hollowed out trunk is used as boats.It is amazing that even the husk, that encloses the shell of the coconut, is used for making ropes, mats, brushes and to stuff mattresses. All over the world, the coconut tree is prized for its different uses. Sometimes it is known as the tree of heaven. It is supposed to have come from the Melanesian islands in the Pacific Ocean. If you had no other tree but the coconut, you could build a house, have a meal and a cool drink, make clothes from leaves, make a broom and even have a soft mattress to sleep on! Can you think of any other uses? The coconut is a symbol of prosperity.“Father, why are these trees so special to you?” asked the prince. “Son, these trees grow in different parts of India and during my travels to different states, I have chosen the most delicious fruit trees of those regions. They all need different kinds of climate to survive. But, here, our soil is so rich and our gardeners so dedicated, that they have been able to raise all these trees. Look at this one. It is a ber tree.”Ber Sometimes on the way to school or walking around the edges of fields, we come across ber bushes. They are thorny, but the little red fruit with a stone in the centre is worth plucking because it is very tasty. There are many different types of bers, some grow on trees with graceful, drooping branches whereas others grow on bushes. Some are round and others have a longish shape, but they all have a wonderful flavour. Ber trees can be about six metres tall and the bushes are only about one metre high. The ber tree and the ber bush are both thorny. The trees have longer thorns and that is why when bers are ripe, people take a long stick with a sharp knife at the end of it, to cut down ripe bers. Sometimes, if the branch is shaken hard, the ripe fruit drops down and can be collected. Ber trees grow in dry places where it does not rain too much. The leaves are eaten by goats, camels and cattle. Silkworms also eat the leaves of the ber. Another very interesting insect called the lac insect lives on the branches of the ber. The insect sucks the juice and secretes a red substance called lac, from which paints, varnishes and dyes are made.Orange We all wait for juicy oranges in the beginning of winter. The tangy smell of a peeled orange is unmistakable. It comes from the oil in the rind. The orange is easy to eat because it can be peeled and each section eaten separately. It is also a great thirst quencher on a hot day. Oranges are full of vitamin C, which keeps colds and coughs away. They also have calcium which is good for strong bones. Orange juice is a popular drink and the flavour of oranges is used in many food products. The best oranges in India come from Nagpur. The trees are about six metres tall, and somewhat thorny.The leaves are dark green and glossy. If you crush a leaf between your fingers, it has a strong tangy smell. If you sit near flowering orange trees, the perfume is very soothing. That is why the flowers are dried and then stuffed into pillows for a good beauty sleep. The rind of the orange is dried and mixed with gram flour to make a scrub for the skin. This can be used instead of soap. In the olden days, ladies in China carried oranges in their hands to keep them smelling sweet. It is thought that the orange tree came from the southern parts of China. Some people think that its origin lies in the foothills of the Himalayas.Chikoo When round, brown chikoos grow on trees, they remind us of soft, brown balls. The skin is a bit fuzzy, and the brownish flesh within is very sweet and has a grainy texture. The chikoo has shiny, long, black seeds inside. The leaves of the tree are longish and glossy. The tree can reach a height of about  metres. This tree was brought from South America many years ago where the Aztec Indians called the tree Chicle. They tapped the bark for the rubbery gum that oozes out of it and made an ancient chewing gum from it. This is how the idea of making chewing gum came to people's minds in modern times. The word chikoo comes from chicle. Chikoos grow best in warm and humid places. The best chikoos come from Maharashtra and central India. In some parts of the world, the chikoo is known as the Sapodilla. This fruit has a very high sugar content. It also has a good amount of vitamin C. In some places, the seeds are made into a paste to cure insect bites and stings. Chikoo ice cream is delicious. Have you tried it?Tamarind The tamarind tree grows to a height of over  metres. It has a long straight trunk with dark brown bark. The branches are strong and supple and droop downwards. The tiny leaves are of a fresh green colour and form graceful, feathery foliage. They are also sour like the tamarind and are nice to eat. The tamarind has beautiful yellow flowers with thin streaks of red. When the flower dries up, its place is taken by a tamarind pod. The pod is green and gradually turns a light brown as it ripens. It is like suede to touch. When it ripens in winter, it becomes a deep brown and the pulp inside is sour with a hint of sweetness. Tamarind seeds are dark brown and enclosed inside the pulp. Squirrels and birds love to eat ripe tamarind. Children also love raw tamarind dipped in rock salt, though it can give them a sore throat sometimes. Tamarind is used to make delicious curries, pickles, chutneys and tangy jal jeera, which is not only cooling in Summer, but also delicious with gol gappas.Tamarind is very rich in iron and vitamin C. The seeds are dried and powdered and can be used as a flour. Tender tamarind leaves and tamarind flowers are also used in cooking. The tree gives very dense shade in summer. There are many superstitions in India about the tamarind tree. People believe that ghosts live on its branches and that one must not sleep under it at night. If you look closely at the leaves of a tamarind tree at night, you will notice that they fold up. Of course, the truth is that, because the big tree breathes out carbon dioxide, it is not healthy to sleep under it at night. It is thought that many, many years ago, the tree was brought from Africa. It began to grow very well in this country and now it is very hard to believe that it came from another country.“Father, what will this new tree grow up to be?” asked the prince excitedly. The King looked at the young tree and then at his son. “Just as you will be king some day, this young tree will grow to bear the king of fruits — the mango! Wait for some time and you will get to taste a fruit like none other.”Mango Who doesn't love delicious mangoes! They are equally tasty, whether they are ripe and golden or green and sour when they are raw and eaten with a bit of salt. We all wait eagerly for the summer season when the mango fruit ripens. It has been rightly called the king of fruits in India. There are many types of mangoes. Some are big and yellow and can weigh almost a kilogram; others are tiny, green and juicy and have to be sucked to be really enjoyed. You can throw a whole lot of mangoes in a bucket of ice water and when they are cool, sit under a tree and enjoy them. It is a good practice to wear old clothes and eat mangoes because their juice can ruin clothes. In India, we have more than a thousand different varieties of mangoes. Wild mango trees originally grew in the Himalayan foothills and spread from there to the rest of the world. The mango tree is about  metres tall. Old trees can sometimes grow up to  metres. Some mango trees in orchards are just about three metres tall.The trunk is a dark brown and the long leaves are pointed at the tips. The crushed leaves have a sharp scent. The mango flowers at the end of the cold weather. The bunches of the little pale yellow flowers have a sweet smell. Honey bees gather nectar from them. Mango leaves are strung on a thread and hung over a doorway, when there is a wedding or any other ceremonial celebration in Hindu households. The motif of a mango can also be found in Indian textiles, saris and various Indian handicrafts. Mango leaves, seeds and flowers are all used for medicine. Mango has lots of vitamin C, which helps us to fight off colds, coughs and gives us healthy gums. Vitamins A and B are also found in this fruit. After admiring the trees for a while the King and his son headed back to the palace. The prince turned back. He smiled and thought to himself, 'Yes, I like our orchard and all its trees, just like father. I will soon grow to be a king and you will too, ' and waved to the young swaying mango tree.Green Gyan Trees are the tallest of all plants in the world and they were present on the earth much before human beings appeared. Trees grow on mountains, along seashores and in hot deserts. We find them growing along the edges of roads, in fields and in our homes and gardens. All plants and trees are necessary for life on earth as they provide oxygen that living beings need to survive. Most plants have a green colouring matter in their leaves called chlorophyll. During the day, when sunlight falls on the leaves, the leaves prepare food for the plants by a process called photosynthesis. They do this with the help of the water absorbed by the roots, the carbon dioxide from the air that enters the leaves through tiny pores on the surface of the leaf, and sunlight. Oxygen is let out into the air as a result of photosynthesis.There are thousands of different types of trees but the ones that give us delicious fruit are the best of them all. All trees bear fruit. However, all fruits are not edible. Some may even be poisonous! But trees are our special friends. They give us shade on a hot day; they provide us with food, timber and medicines. When trees grow over a large area, they form forests. Forests affect the climate of a place, prevent soil erosion and provide a habitat for a variety of animals. We must look after trees and plant trees if we can, so that we have a healthy environment.	./Story text files/333.txt	20396	21	5.800704579768495	1663	324	178	69.57785467128028	98	191	38	14.069204152249135	52	237	1203	784	5	1.4893711248892825	1980	278

One day old Mrs. Chang in the village got a letter. It was from her son Chen, who lived far away in Beijing. She could not read, so she waited in front of her house for someone to come by who could read out the letter to her. After some time, Warrior Wen came by, swinging his exquisitely carved staff. Old Mrs. Chang stopped him and said, “O brave warrior, could you do me a favour and read out this letter from my son to me?” Warrior Wen immediately agreed.He took the letter from the old lady and opened it. Mrs. Chang sat down in eager anticipation of news from her dear son. But one look at the letter and Warrior Wen began to wail loudly. “What is it, Warrior Wen? What is it? Tell me, is something wrong with my son?” asked old Mrs. Chang anxiously. But Warrior Wen didn’t say a word – he only looked up at her and began to wail even louder than before.Poor Mrs. Chang was sure that something dreadful had happened to her son. Tears welled up in her eyes and she began wailing loudly too. Plish… plosh… plish… plosh. . . the tears rolled down the cheeks of the brave warrior and the old lady. Plish… plosh…plish…plosh. . . the tears rolled down the cheeks of the brave warrior and the old lady.A little later, Peddler Peng came by. And what do you think he did when he saw the old lady and the warrior wailing in unison? Well, he sat down with them and began crying too! What a racket they created! The three wailers sobbibng their hearts out… Waaaaaaaa… baaaaaaaawwww…… boooooooo……. Hoooooooo…….Hearing the cacophonic cries, Master Ming, whose school was just around the corner from Mrs. Chang’s house, came rushing out. Several curious kids followed suit – some giggling, some chattering, some whispering, but all delighted that their class had been interrupted! When Master Ming saw the weeping chorus, he ran up to them worriedly. What could have gone so terribly wrong, he wondered, as he sprinted down the road. “Booooooooo…… hoooooooooooo…. Waaaaaaaaaaaa…. .” came the response. Master Ming was beginning to lose his patience. “Out with it you howling hyenas!” he thundered. Taken aback by his roar that was even louder than their waaaaaa. . . ils, Peddler Peng was the first to answer.“Sniff… sob… Just a year ago,” he said, and wiped his running nose, “I had made a hundred earthen pots to be sold in the market. But as I was on my way, the donkey that was carrying them got frightened by his own shadow and started to bray loudly! And my pots, they all came tumbling down one by one and broke into a million pieces. Not even one beautiful pot was left unbroken. I was so upset. I wanted to cry and cry and cry then, but I couldn’t do it because I had to immediately think up ways to make up for my losses. So I postponed it. Today, when I saw the two of them crying, I was reminded of that heartbreaking episode and decided to cry for my precious, pretty pots. Waaaaaa….”Before Master Ming could react, Mrs. Chang spoke. “I got a letter from my son in Beijing this morning. I don’t know how to read, so I asked Warrior Wen to read it out for me. But he began crying as soon as he opened the letter. Something terrible must have happened to my son! Something awful, horrible, unimaginable… O my poor Chen, poor, poor Chen…. Booo…. Hoooo…. .” Even as an exasperated Master Ming consoled old Mrs. Chang, Warrior Wen bravely fought back his tears and opened his mouth. “To tell you the truth, Master, I didn’t read my books very well when I was in school. I never paid any attention to my teachers and to my lessons, so I still don’t know how to read. I am so ashamed of myself! Bawwwwww……….” he wailed. Master Ming was dumbstruck!LANTERN IN A JIFFY!

The river rushed all around her. GhumGhum paddled her feet and swished her tail. ""Look, Papa! I’m swimming! Look…! """"… Papa? "" GhumGhum looked in front and looked behind.

"There was a mouse in the house. Grandma saw it first. ""Mouse! "" she screamed, jumping up the sofa. The cushions fell on the floor.“Where?” asked Pa, climbing up the window. He pulled the curtains down. “There!” shouted Ma, leaping up the table. The plates fell with a crash.“Catch him!” said Mithun to the cat. The cat looked at the mouse and fled under the bed! “Mouse!” screamed Mithun, running behind the cat.“I will chase it out!” said Ma bravely. She took out the broom and poked here and there. “Mouse!” shouted Pa. “Behind you!” Ma looked at the mouse, and fled under the bed!""I know what to do! "" shouted Grandma jumping down from the sofa. She rolled up a newspaper and poked here and there.“Mouse!” yelled Pa, climbing the window even higher. “To your left!” Grandma looked at the mouse, and fled under the bed.“Oh no!” said Pa softly. He couldn’t go any higher. He climbed down carefully, and fled under the bed before the mouse could see him!""Mouse in the House! "" shouted everyone together. That woke Baby up.

Babuji’s pen lay on the table tempting little Kasni. She felt it was pulling her like a magnet. She wanted to pick it up and draw. On paper, on the floor and on the wall. Anywhere…as long as she could draw. She knew how to draw a few things well now. A pot, a mango and a parrot…Kasni had first tried to draw with pieces of red brick. A pot, a mango or a parrot on the floor or on the trunk of a tree. Then she was given a piece of white chalk and told to try her hand on her black slate. A white parrot taking shape on a black slate was good, but soon she was tired of it. 'This is no fun…so many colours all around me but my pot, my mango and my parrot are all just…white, ’ she thought.“I don’t want this chalk!” she told her father one day. “Why?” Babuji could not understand why she was bored. “Because I can only make white things with it.” “Well, with a white chalk, you can only make white things!” he smiled.“But there are so many other colours!” “Right,” said Babuji beginning to see the problem. He put his hand into his office bag and pulled out a pencil. “Here, try this,” said Babuji. Kasni's face lit up. His bag could be her slate, she thought. But before the tip of the pencil touched the bag, Babuji stopped her. “No. Not on this. I will give you a piece of paper.”Kasni did not lose a moment. Her fingers and the pencil danced like magic on the lovely blank sheet.Now her pot was brown. Her mango and her parrot were a lovely brown too. Kasni always had her precious pencil with her. At home, in school and in the garden, she carried it with her. This was fine for a few days until one day she was bored…again. How can everything be brown and only brown? Babuji’s pen lying on the table could free her from a brown world. Babuji always filled it with blue ink. It was his most favourite pen and stayed in his office bag. Today it lay outside for some reason. Kasni looked at it longingly. Its golden cap resting on its green body looked very grand. Like a golden crown on a rich green bed of grass. Blue ink winked through the transparent part in the body. When the pen was used a lot, the blue ink dropped down like mercury in a thermometer when your fever goes down.Kasni went closer. The blue ink in the green pen seemed to send her a signal and she picked it up. She turned the cap and took it off. The slim, lightyellow nib seemed to smile at her.Kasni touched its tip. Ah! It was like the delicate nip of a butterfly. She replaced the cap and hid the pen in her dress. ‘I need paper. A plain white sheet of paper, ’ she thought. ‘Ah, where can I get it? ’ Her mind raced. ‘Let me tear off a page from my school note book so that nobody will know. ’ She ran to the room with the cupboard. But her mother’s cupboard was locked. Her school bag was in the same cupboard.‘Oh! When will Ma come back? When will this lock be opened? And how will I tear off a page in front of her? ’ The pen hidden in her dress tickled her. The ink sparkled blue in the green pen. Kasni took off the cap again. The yellow nib still smiled at her. Kasni looked to her left and then to her right. In front of her was a white wall as inviting as a sheet of paper.Kasni went closer. ‘What shall I make? ’ she thought, as she gently tapped her head with the other end of the pen, just like she had seen Babuji do so often. By the third tap, she knew. ‘A parrot! ’ She put the pen to the wall but the uneven surface made it hard for the pen to work. The lines drawn to make the parrot’s body began to waver. As Kasni tried to work better the pen began to make scratchy sounds.A scared Kasni examined the nib. The tip of the nib had some powdery lime on it. The blue wavy lines on the stark white wall looked beautiful. Kasni felt her power over one more colour. She cleaned the tip of her nib with her dress and began drawing the beak of the parrot.Scratch. . . scratch…the scratchiness grew. Kasni pressed a little harder and the pen stopped. Kasni pressed again. A soft sound, ‘chat’ and the nib broke. Kasni froze. She felt the tip of the nib in a panic. The tip had parted into two bits that curled sadly in different directions. Babuji’s favourite pen in this state! What would happen when Babuji would return in the evening! She quickly closed the pen and kept it on the table. As evening came closer, her heart beat so hard that she did not go out to play. Babuji came home and went into the inner room. Kasni’s heart was in her mouth. Babuji looked relieved to see the pen on the table. He picked it up to put it in his bag. Kasni thought she had been saved. But no, he changed his mind. He was taking off the cap as if to check if the pen was fine before he put it in his bag. Kasni covered her eyes with her hands in fright.“Who touched my pen?” he rumbled angrily. It seemed he had seen the wall. Kasni trembled as she came in. “Did you do this?” asked Babuji, waving the pen in front of her. He pointed to the wall and said, “You ruined the pen and the wall. Now set it right.” He flung the pen down. Kasni had never seen him so angry. Kasni looked at her mother who was trying to rub off the parrot on the wall. Half the parrot’s beak had vanished. It looked as if Ma had broken its beak. Kasni looked at it and burst into tears. Ma tried to soothe her and finally led her to the outer room.Kasni's tears flowed freely. She wiped them in vain and her nose ran. Suddenly she heard a tapping on the window. Her mouth hung open as she saw the same parrot sitting on the ledge outside. The parrot with the broken beak! It had to be some other parrot! She thought it must be some other parrot that had come flying there by chance. But this parrot was not green, it was blue! The same blue as the ink in Babuji’s pen. “This is my parrot! The one I drew on the wall!” She ran to the window.“You? Here?” “Yes, I’m here!” The parrot’s voice was unlike that of other parrots. It had a hiss rather than a twang. “But how did you get here?” “Why? Didn’t you draw me on the wall?” “Yes. What is your name?” asked Kasni. “You will have to give me a name as you drew me.” “Right. Let me think…” said Kasni tapping her head like Babuji. “Neelkanth…no, that is another bird. Neelgai. . . no, that is another kind of cow, I think. Then…Neelpankhi…your name is Neelpankhi, the one with the blue feathers.”“Why Neelpankhi?” “Because you are blue and not green like other parrots. Your feathers are as blue as the ink in Babuji’s pen. Got it Miya Mitthu?” Kasni felt quite proud of how smart she was. Mitthu rather liked his name too. He opened his beak to say ‘tain tain’ but instead of a twang there came a soft hiss. The parrot looked sad.“What is wrong with your voice? Why don’t you speak clearly as other parrots do?” “This is how a brokenbeaked parrot sounds!” said Neelpankhi morosely. Kasni felt angry with Ma. “It is all Ma’s fault. If she had not wiped the wall, your beak would not have broken.”“It is not your Ma’s fault.” “Whose fault was it then?” “Yours!” “How is it my fault?” “You should not have drawn me on the wall. You broke the pen and my beak. If you had drawn me on paper, the pen and my beak would have been safe. I’d come to tell you this. . . and I had better be going now,” Neelpankhi said as he flew away.“Wait! Listen to me!” Kasni leapt to catch him. Her head bumped against the window frame. “Oh!” she said as her eyes flew open. She was on her bed.Her head had bumped against the wall. The parrot was on the wall with its broken beak. Kasni woke up next morning.She could hear Babuji’s voice from the other room. She got up quietly and went to him. Babuji had his back to her as he read the paper. “Babuji,” she said. He turned and looked at her with deep eyes. He did not speak. Kasni lifted her hands and held her ears, silently saying sorry.Babuji got up and hugged her. “Little Kasni, I will get colour pencils and paper for you today. Draw a green parrot with a full beak. Call it Suapankhi, the one with the green feathers.” Kasni’s eyes shone as she thought of that.	./Story text files/42.txt	7994	20	5.346570397111913	737	94	118	38.57920792079208	150	52	26	8.727722772277227	101	101	522	309	5	1.237613751263903	919	70
It was a cold night, but Pipsqueak was not ready to return home yet. His bright eyes sparkled as he and his friends, Mandra and Bedomi, flew around the street lights. The light drizzle did not seem to bother the insects flying around.This suited the young insecteating bats just fine. Pip simply loved mosquitoes for dinner. “Yumyumyum! I got another one!” he sang. The three friends were having a competition – who would eat the most mosquitoes in one hour!Half an hour into the hunt, Pipsqueak had already caught a hundred and fifty insects. This was going to be a good night.Suddenly, there was a ringing in his ears and he started to drop towards the ground. Bedomi, a bigger bat, swung by his side.“What’s the matter, Pip? Are you all right?” she asked. “Nooo, my ears!” cried Pip in distress. He spiralled down to the nearest branch and hung upside down. “Ow, ow. . . They hurt!”Mandra set off to fetch Pipsqueak’s mother and Bedomi stayed behind to comfort Pip. Pipsqueak was feeling very strange indeed. He felt dizzy. His ears twitched and every movement was painful.Bedomi used her powerful ears to scan the air for Pipsqueak’s mother. She was worried that Lyra, the bat who fed on birds, frogs, reptiles and injured bats, might attack Pip. She covered him with her furry wing. Soon, Mandra returned with Pip’s mama who took him to the doctor.Doctor Ella looked at his ears closely. She shook her head, and said, “Your ears have become too cold, Pip. Don’t you know that we Pipistrelles don’t do well in the rain?” Pipsqueak started to mumble in protest, “It’s just drizzling, not raining…” But the doctor slipped some medicine into his mouth for the pain. Then she pulled out a chart. “Our ears are very important, Pipsqueak, because we use echolocation to find food. Do you know what that means?”Pip shook his head. He was already feeling a little better. “We insect bats send out signals through our noses. These signals bounce off objects and become echoes. And the echoes come back and tell us what that object is,” the doctor continued. “Oh, yes! The echoes are all different. If they show that there’s an insect, we catch and eat it. But if it is a tree or a wall, we avoid flying into it,” said Pip excitedly.“Mama says our ears are like radars!” Pipsqueak was no longer in pain, and was enjoying this little lesson. “Yes!” agreed Dr. Ella. “Humans use radars in airports, ships and submarines to find objects. And we use our senses to find food. Our noses and ears are so powerful that we don’t really need to use our eyes too much. That’s why we have such small eyes, you know.”“Is that why humans shriek when we go near them? They think we are blind and may get stuck in their hair, ha ha! Thank you, Doc,” said Pip. “You are welcome, Pip. Now, remember, no more hunting tonight. You can beat your mosquitohunting record tomorrow,” said Doctor Ella, grinning.Pipsqueak and Mandra Pipsqueak and Mandra are tiny bats – their scientific names are Pipistrellus tenuis and Pipistrellus coromandra. They live close to humans – the cracks of buildings, below roof tiles, under window ewes, behind photo frames and in tree holes. Bedomi Bedomi is a ‘Lesserwoolly Horseshoe Bat’ found in the forests of India and Sri Lanka. Its scientific name is Rhinolophus beddomei.Lyra Lyra belongs to the family of bats called Megaderma lyra. These carnivorous bats are also known as ‘False Vampire Bats’. Doctor Ella represents all Pipistrellas, a genus of bats.We can’t hear them Bats make clicking sounds that humans cannot hear. Scientists use a detector to listen to the highpitch call of a bat on a computer. The sound waves from bats bounce off solid objects. These create echoes. Just like Pipsqueak, radars in submarines also use echolocation to navigate underwater. In seawater, sound travels over four times faster than in air. Amazingly, some people who have lost their sight have gained the ability to use their sense of hearing more and use echolocation to find their way around.We need our bats Bats are the only flying mammals. There are ,  species of bats, and they all fall under the order Chiroptera. This word is Greek for ‘hand wing’. There are two kinds of bats  insect eaters and fruit eaters. Bats are found almost all over the world. In the Western Ghats alone, where Pip and his friends play, we know of  species. Bats help keep pests under control, and in spreading seeds so that trees can grow. Unfortunately, bats are at the risk of extinction. This is partly because people mistakenly believe they are pests. Scientists make Red Assessment Lists that tell us which animals are getting extinct and how we can save them.. Rhinolophus beddomei  Photo credit: Dr. Sanjay Molur .

High up on the snowy mountains of the Himalayas lived the beautiful little Bhabhloo Bear. Bhabhloo Bear’s fur was long, black and shiny, with not even one white hair on it. Bhabhloo was a very, very naughty bear, loved by everyone in the jungle, but most of all, by his mother. But he was really very naughty.From early morning to nightfall, Bhabhloo would jump and play and run through the jungle and his mother would call after him, “Bhabhloo, beta, don’t be so naughty.” “Bhabhloo, sit for a little while, rest a bit…” “Oh no, Bhabhloo, you’ll get hurt, beta, be careful!” “Bhabhloo, it’s late now, it’s night time, go to sleep now, son…”Ma would keep trying to control Bhabhloo, and fullofbeans Bhabhloo would think of new things to do, not listening to a word his mother said. This is a story about just such a night. Ma was very tired. Who could blame her? She had been running after Bhabhloo and scolding him all over the jungle, all day long. But Bhabhloo was still too excited to sleep. His mind buzzed with questions. His mind buzzed with questions. “Where does the sun sleep at night?” “Who is the moon’s mother?” “At night, when I am not sleepy, why is Ma sleepy?” “Why? …Where? …When? …How? … How? …When? …Where? …Why? … ”Bhabhloo’s head buzzed with all these questions till he was quite dizzy. He just could not lie still any longer, so he quietly slipped out of the den and sat outside in the cool night air. Strange sounds filled the night. The kikitkit of crickets, the hwashhwaaasshh of the wind in the trees. The jungle was lit up brightly by the full moon that hung low. But still, questions flitted in Bhabhloo’s head like restless butterflies.Actually, it had long been Bhabhloo’s dream to do something, anything that would make the whole world sit up and notice him. Something, anything that would make bears, big and small, say, “Wow! Bhabhloo has made Himalayan bears famous throughout the world!” But how? What was that special something that would make a baby bear famous worldwide?Lost in thought, Bhabhloo’s eye fell on a tall deodar tree as it swayed in the night breeze. Whenever the tree swayed one way, it looked as if the highest branches were touching the moon. Suddenly Bhabhloo had a most brilliant idea! His eyes shone, his hair stood on end in excitement, and he felt like dancing! ! ! But he knew that if he made a noise, his mother would wake up and then he would be immediately packed off to his bed. And if she found out what was in Bhabhloo’s head she would get angry with him and his dream would remain incomplete…Oh yes, you are probably thinking what in the world could have got into Bhabhloo’s head after seeing the tree, that would make his dreams of fame come true? Well, I will tell you. He had always been an expert at climbing trees. Now he would just climb up that tall deodar tree. And then, when the wind made the tree sway and touch the moon, he would leap up in an instant and jump… straight… onto…THE MOON!He knew that he would be the First Bear on the Moon! The whole world would be amazed. All the bears in the jungle would be jealous. Especially SonaMona, who always made fun of Bhabhloo and his dreams. Scientists with big, fat telescopes (Ma had told him about them) would see him dancing on the moon.Newspapers would write about him and print his pictures. Everyone would want to interview him and ask him all sorts of questions. Bhabhloo would answer while sitting on the moon…and maybe he would find some of the answers he was looking for himself.Hmmmm … I wish there had been some intelligent child like you around to explain some things to Bhabhloo at that time. Maybe you could have explained to him that no matter how tall a tree may be, of course it can’t touch the moon! From far down below, it just looks like its stretching branches are touching the sky. BUT, there was nobody like you around to talk sense into Bhabhloo.Finally after taking a deep breath Bhabhloo, the bear, headed towards the jungle. A cold breeze was blowing but Bhabhloo was so lost in his thoughts that he didn’t even notice the cold. And he was protected against the icy wind by his thick armour of bearhair.Bhabhloo began running as fast as his fat legs could carry him. Faster…. faster… he kept running till he reached his tree. He looked up at the tree from the jungle floor…Yes! YES! His guess was exactly right. The tree really was sky high.Without wasting a single moment, Bhabhloo began climbing the tree. Higher…higher…higher. . . and higher still. The tree was huge. The higher he climbed, the colder it got. He also noticed that the branches of the tree were getting thinner.He asked himself, “Are the branches becoming thinner or am I just becoming fatter?” But Bhabhloo didn’t really care much. He just kept right on climbing. Higher…and higher still. Eventually he reached the top. Happiness (and chilliness and highness! ) were making Bhabhloo’s head spin. He thought, “AAH! The moment has come when everything will change.” His dreams were just one long jump away. BUT…but of course, you know what happened, don’t you?When he reached the very tippytippy top and lifted his head to take that final leap, he found that…that…that… the moon was still as far away from him as it had been from the ground. It was still very, very, very faaaaar away… It was only then that Bhabhloo realized how foolish he had been. He realized how true his mother’s words were when she said, “Bhabhloo, you jump into doing something first, you think about it only afterwards.” Bhabhloo knew that the best thing for him to do was to quietly, quietly get down the tree and creep back to his cave, before anyone knew what he had been doing. BUT… Just as he was about to start going down the tree, there was a strange sound.KADAK! KADAAK! ! Kadak? Kadak? KADHIK! KAAADHIK! ! ! Kadhik? Kadhik? ?What strange sounds were these? Yes, you’ve guessed it; the thin, weak branches at the top of the tree were bending and breaking under Bhabhloo’s weight! And then…MMAMAMEEEE! M MM MUMMMMMEEEEE…. . DHUPPPP! ! !And all around, there was silence. No rustle, not a sound could be heard. Bhabhloo’s mother suddenly awoke from a deeeeeep sleep. “Bhabhloo?” she called out, as she looked around. But Bhabhloo wasn’t there. “Bhabhloo…?” “Bhabhloooo?” “Bhabhloo, my son, where are you?” “BH…AAAA…LOOOOOOO! ! ! !” OH! Her voice shook, her eyes filled with tears of fear. Puffing and panting, trembling from head to toe, Ma Bear ran through the jungle, shouting and calling for her beloved son. “BHABHLOO…. ? ! ? ! ! !” But Bhabhloo lay there, still, on the cold, wet jungle floor. He didn’t look up, he didn’t stir. His eyes were closed. He was absolutely still. Silent. “Bhabhloo…. oh no…” Ma went up to Bhabhloo’s still body. She turned him over. OHHHHHH…. A deep wound had torn his chest. His blood slowly reddened the jungle floor. And Bhabhloo lay still. Unmoving.“Bhabhloo, my son, what’s happened, beta?” Ma’s voice shook and tears dripped. Is this the end of Bhabhloo’s story? Here, at this sad, sorry turn? Come with me and let’s find out. Ma leaned over her son, sobbing. Suddenly, she felt a tickly tickling in her paw. What was this? A little sliver of silver thread was dancing on her paw. A long thread that seemed to hang from the sky. Looking up, she saw the moon. Then she realized that the long ‘thread’ was really a moonbeam. She looked up and saw the moon smile and wink. It seemed to tell her…hurry up!Ma understood immediately what the moon wanted her to do. She quickly picked up a pine needle from the forest floor and threaded the moonbeam through it. Then quickly, quickly, she began to sew the tear on Bhabhloo’s chest. As the last stitch was put in place, Bhabhloo opened his eyes.“Ma…? Mummy…I’m sorry…that, that tree…the moon…I thought… but then…I’m very, very sorry, mummy!” But Ma’s eyes were overflowing with tears of happiness. She hugged her son and said, “It’s alright my son, it’s alright, everything will be alright now.”By this time, all the bears of the jungle had gathered to see what was happening. And when they saw the shining ‘V’ on Bhabhloo’s chest, they were surprised. They didn’t know that it was a moonbeam. They all began to shout, “Wow, Bhabhloo!” And some pretty girls giggled, “You are surely the most beautiful, handsomest bear in this jungle, Bhabhloo.”And what about SonaMona? Well, they stood by silently. What could they possibly say? After all, Bhabhloo’s dream of being famous had come true. And when all the bears got to know the story about Bhabhloo and how he got his silver ‘V’, they began to shout that they also wanted one on their chests. Ma looked up at the moon who smiled back and nodded.So Ma Bear threaded moonbeams into many deodar pine needles and sewed shining silver ‘V’s onto the other bears’ chests. As the line got longer and longer, she sewed harder and faster. Bhabhloo laughed and clapped his paws together as he told and retold his story. Until he suddenly realized that he hadn’t said ‘thank you’ to the moon. He looked up now and OH NO!“Stop Ma, stop, look what’s happened to the moon!” And yes, when they looked up, the moon was a thin, thin slice, instead of the round circle that it had been. The bears all felt very bad, “We’ve taken so many moonbeams, that the moon has become small and weak,” they cried. But the moon smiled again and said, “Doesn’t matter, my friends, after just a few days, I’ll be well and whole again. Just watch my magic!”And yes, after some weeks, the moon was again big and round. And then it was time for Ma Bear to sew more ‘V’s onto more bear chests. And even today, you can look up at the sky and tell: when the moon is very thin, you will know that up in the snowy Himalayas, Bhabhloo’s mother has been stitching more ‘V’s on bear chests. And then, when the moon is slowly becoming a big round ‘O’, then you’ll know that Ma is letting the moon rest.What’s that you said? What about Bhabhloo? Ah yes, our little friend did become famous for being the first bear with the shiny ‘V’ on his chest. Without his adventure, the great Himalayan bear would have been a plain, plain black. When you go to the zoo next, or look at a book, remember to look for the Himalayan bear. Then you’ll know for sure that this story is true.	./Story text files/240.txt	10260	21	5.877413127413128	810	226	272	49.299019607843135	122	82	51	9.985294117647058	106	98	646	390	6	1.3024026512013256	1117	90
Raju lives in the city. But every summer, when school is out, he heads straight for his Ajja’s house in the village. One of the things he loves to do there is to take a walk along the river with Ajja and Ajji.The river in Ajja’s village is always clear and cool. Its banks are lined with pale yellow sand and lush green trees, dotted here and there with huge boulders. At some places, steps lead right down to the water! When the trees are in bloom, everything looks so beautiful it takes your breath away.“Why don’t we go down to the river this evening?” asked Ajji one day. “Can we, really, Ajji?” asked Raju, excited. “Of course we can!” said Ajja. “Maybe Raju would also enjoy a boat ride on the river. Do you think you would like that, Raju?” “It sounds wonderful!” said Raju.That evening, Raju, Ajja and Ajji went down to the river. Ajji was carrying a picnic basket full of Raju’s favourite eats. The three of them sat in a cool mango grove on the riverbank, watching children playing around them. From where they sat, they could see a number of people enjoying an evening swim in the river. Some of them were teaching their children to swim too.All the children were swimming with something long and white tied to their backs. “What is that on their backs, Ajja?” asked Raju, puzzled. “It is a vegetable called a bottle gourd,” explained Ajja. “The gourd is hollowed out, then left to dry in the sun. When it is completely dry, it floats on water. Tie it to your back and you will float in the water too! That way, you can learn to swim without worrying about drowning.”“That sounds like fun,” said Raju. “Ajja, do you think I could learn swimming with a gourd too? I really want to!”“Why not?” said Ajja. “You can start tomorrow.” “Really? I would love that!” said Raju, delighted. Why, maybe he would be a champion swimmer by the end of his summer vacation!After their little picnic, Ajja, Ajji, and Raju walked along the river until they reached a jetty. There were several rowboats tied up at the jetty. Ajja pointed to one of the boatmen, and said, “These are the people who row the boats and take people on rides on the river.”Ajja spoke to one of the boatmen, who agreed to take them all on a ride. The boat was tossing about gently in the water, making Raju a little nervous about stepping into it. Ajja held his arm firmly and helped him in. Once the boat began to move, Raju’s fears disappeared and he began to enjoy the ride.The river flowed calm and gentle. The water lapped against the sides of the boat and the boatmen sang in rhythm, rowing strongly with both arms. Little fish leaped out of the water and went back in. The pleasant evening breeze stirred up the water and the grasses. Raju trailed his hand in the cool water of the river. He was enjoying himself.“Are you enjoying the ride?” asked Ajja, breaking into his thoughts. “Very much, Ajja,” smiled Raju. “When you go back home, don’t forget to tell your friends about your boat ride!” said Ajji.“I won’t, Ajji,” said Raju. “And I’m sure they will all agree that I am a very lucky boy indeed.”Use your imagination and colour this picture any way YOU like.Use your imagination and colour this picture any way YOU like.	./Story text files/49.txt	3200	15	5.637426900584796	286	56	124	49.80952380952381	31	32	26	10.238095238095237	26	37	222	120	5	1.426356589147287	364	23

Anu likes many things about Daddy. She likes the bright paper lanterns he makes, the crisp onion pakodas he fries and the cute tortoise he makes out of paper. Besides, he climbs the stairs with a hop, and wrestles with Uncle for fun. When guests come over, he always makes them laugh. Anu likes all these things about Daddy. But do you know what Anu likes most of all? Daddy's moustache!Every morning as Daddy shaves, Anu sits by and watches him carefully. Daddy holds his tiny pair of scissors between his two fingers, and with a snipsnipsnip he trims his moustache. Anu says, “Now a little to the left…now a bit to the right…no no, Daddy! Don’t make your moustache small! I won’t talk to you if you do!”When Daddy comes out of the shower, Anu takes a little comb and brushes his moustache neatly. She then holds both ends between her fingertips and gives them a twirl! Then Daddy’s moustache looks stiff and proud. “Done, Daddy! Now don’t you mess it up, okay?” she says sternly.Anu always thinks, if Daddy wears a smart tunic and a turban and rides a tall horse, with a sword across his belt, how grand he'll look! Just like a soldier wearing glasses!Actually, Anu likes anyone with a moustache. Like the dad of her friend Tuti, whose real name is Smruti. He has such a fat moustache! He must need a big fat comb to brush it. Tuti’s dad plays very good tennis. But really, he should be a wrestler. If he wears a pleated turban and carries a giant club on his shoulder, he’ll look just great!Sahil’s dad has a pencilthin moustache. Anu wonders how he manages to trim it so fine. If he wears a tall black hat, a long black overcoat and dark glasses, he’ll look just like the detective on TV, who catches all the thieves!But Grandpa who lives next door has the best moustache of all! It looks as if a big white cloud has come down from the sky to live under his nose! His mouth is hidden behind the cloud. Anu is anxious about Grandpa. . . how can he eat with that cloud in the way?Anu wonders why a moustache doesn’t grow under her nose. Every morning she wets her soap, makes a lot of lather and gives herself many different kinds of moustaches. “My moustache is the best,” she says. “It’s pure white, and so soft! Isn’t it nice?” she asks, happily.	./Story text files/315.txt	2251	17	5.633333333333334	203	37	140	50.18181818181818	28	16	28	10.454545454545455	23	21	132	108	4	1.356115107913669	263	15
“STOP pulling my hair!” shouts Zoya. “First you stop calling me Fatso!” Armaan yells at his sister. “Children, behave yourselves!” says Ma. “Remember, you are at my clinic. There are patients waiting outside. Both of you are disturbing them!”“But Ma –” “Enough! If I hear another sound from either of you, I will punish you both,” says Ma sternly., , . . . a few seconds pass in silence. But the peace does not last! “This is your fault, Zoya. Why do you have to be so stupid?” “Who are you calling stupid, slowpoke? You can’t even spell stupid.” “Stop calling me names! I’ll tell Ma,” says Armaan, pinching Zoya’s arm.“You are such a tattletale!” says Zoya, shoving her brother. Armaan loses his balance. He topples over backwards and bumps into something hard. CRASH!Oh, no! Zoya and Armaan stare at the pile of bones lying on the ground. “See what a mess you’ve made of Ma’s skeleton model!” says an upset Zoya. “This is all your fault! You are the one who pushed me!” yells Armaan.“We better do something quickly! Otherwise, we’ll both be in trouble,” says Zoya. Armaan nods and picks up a bone. “This one could be the head bone. It has two holes for eyes, one hole for the nose, and teeth below.” “You’re right,” says Zoya. “That’s definitely the head bone. This is like a puzzle. We just need to figure out which bone goes where.”“Where do you think this goes?” asks Zoya, picking up a big cage like bone. “Um. . . well,” Armaan makes a fist with his hand and raps the middle part of his body, “I think that cage on top must be the chest. And the space below must be for the tummy.” Zoya nods and smiles. The two of them hold the piece together and mount it onto the stand.“Look at this piece. Don’t these bones look like fingerbones?” asks Zoya, wiggling the small bones at Armaan. “I think this is an arm. Can you look for the other one?“How do you know that it isn’t a leg bone?” asks Armaan. “Watch me!” Zoya sits down and places her hand flat on the floor next to her foot.In no time, Armaan finds the other arm bone and two leg bones. “The hands bones are shorter than the foot bones. We must be right!” says Armaan. Zoya stands on her tiptoes to fix the arm bones while Armaan attaches the leg bones to the skeleton model.They hear Ma's voice outside, telling a patient to get rest, and visit again in a week. It sounds like she’s almost done! Only the skull remains to be fixed. Oh, no! They can’t reach. “Quick, Armaan, pull that chair here,” whispers Zoya. She climbs on to the chair and places the skull right at the top of the skeleton. Armaan drags the chair back to its place. Just in time!“We’ve done it!” Zoya hugs Armaan. Ma walks in. “It is nice to see the two of you hugging. I'm done for the day! Let's go get icecream,” she says.“By the way, you were both very clever to put the skeleton back together correctly,” says Ma. Zoya and Armaan look at each other in surprise. How did Ma know?Fun Bone Facts . Your hands have the most number of bones in the human body. . A newborn baby has around  bones. As you grow, you are left with  bones. .

"Look, it snowed last night! As the sun rises, seven sisters wake up in their house.""Come, let’s play,” Parvati says. “Are we going to slide down the slope?” Chiya asks. “YES!” yells Resam.Parvati is first. She sits on her snowboard. “Ready. . . one, two, three, GO!” Parvati pushes with her hands. She slides smoothly down the slope. “Wheeee!” she shouts, giggling.Resam and Chiya are next. Chiya looks nervous. “Come with me,” says Resam. They hold hands and walk downhill. They count their steps. Their shoes leave prints in the snow.Uttara is fourth. She looks down at her sisters. She is not afraid! She crawls carefully down the slope on her hands and knees. “Very good,” says Parvati. ""Some day, you'll climb high mountains, Uttara! ""Purva is fifth. She tumbles and rolls like a snowball, all the way down the slope. It is a funny sight and the girls laugh.Varsha is sixth. She lies on her stomach and slowly slides down the slope.Suddenly, the sky grows dark and it turns windy. There’s a storm coming! “Girls, come back inside!” Mama shouts.Uttara is scared. She tries to crawl up the slope but keeps sliding back down. ""I want to go to Mama, "" she cries.Purva runs uphill. Her feet sink in. She can’t climb higher. She is stuck!Resam and Chiya try to climb up as well. But they both come sliding down. Oh no! What will they do now?Nritya is at the top of the slope. She is the eldest. ""Wait! "" she yells. She runs into her house and brings back a long rope. She ties one end to a tree. She throws the other end to her sisters.“Uttara,” she shouts, “Don’t be scared. Hold on tight to the rope! I will pull you up.” Uttara grips the rope tightly. Nriyta pulls her to the top.“Phew,” says Parvati, “We made it!” The seven sisters run into their house just as it starts to snow again. Mama pours them all hot tea from a kettle. What an adventure they’ve had today!Why Do We Slip? The seven sisters in the story slid down and climbed up a slope. They walked, they slid, they crawled, and they rolled. There is something between your body and the ground that gives you the ability to walk. This is called friction. Without friction, you would not be able to stand for long or even walk. When there is very less friction between our body and the ground, we slip and slide.Did you know that words such as grip, slip and slide are related to friction?

Bheema loves to sleep and just cannot get up early. Ramu, the washerman, scolds Bheema often.One day, Gauri, the cow, asked him, “Bheema, why are you so sad?” Bheema said, “I cannot get up early and Ramu shouts at me every day. Will you wake me up every morning, please?” “Yes, I will,” said Gauri. Early next morning, Gauri mooed loudly, but Bheema did not wake up.Coming back from the river in the evening, Bheema met Moti, the dog. “I can never get up in the morning on time. Will you wake me up?” Bheema asked Moti. “Yes, I will,” said Moti and the next morning he barked and barked but did Bheema wake up? No Sir!That evening Bheema met Cheenu, the rooster. He said to Cheenu, “You crow in the morning and everybody wakes up. Will you wake me up too?” Cheenu agreed. The next morning, Cheenu crowed long and loud, but Bheema did not wake up.The next evening, Bheema saw Kalu, the crow, cawing away happily. “Kalu, will you wake me up in the morning, please?” he asked.

But the bamboo pole just fell short.The kite did not budge but many mangoes fell to the ground because of the bamboo. Sweet and sour ones. Raju and Muniya began to eat the mangoes. Slurp! They were both happy now. There came a strong gust of wind. The kite flew away.A bird was giving flying lessons to her young chicks. The chicks were a little scared.

“I completely let go of fear. Fear of norms and fear of society. I was neither afraid of failure, nor dying. I believed in my own strengths and nurtured my natural talent. I improved my weaknesses. And above all, I always followed my heart” —Tine Mena, mountaineerToday is a big day for Tine Mena. At the age of , she has become the first woman from Northeast India to climb Everest. At ,  metres, Everest is the highest mountain in the world. It’s as high as five thousand men (who are six feet tall) standing on top of each other! This is the story of Tine’s journey, a girl who loves to climb mountains.Whooshoo! Whooshoo! In the Mishmi hills of Arunachal Pradesh, Tine heard a wondrous call from the distant mountains. She was drawn to it, a sound only she could hear.Tine loved to climb. She climbed trees, ran through the jungle and went fishing in the river. She was as fearless and strong as Naaya, her grandmother. If Tine fell down, Naaba, her father, would tell her to get up and carry on.Tine and her younger sister Sony loved eating apples, oranges, and berries from the forest. They spent long days lying under the sun. Ah, Tine would smile, what a wonderful life!But one day, Tine’s world turned upside down. There was no school in Echali, so her family moved to the closest big town, Roing. There, the ‘Whooshoo’ became a faint whisper. All she wanted was to be in the mountains.Ten years later, Tine finished school. The mountain call was strong again  whoshooo, whoshooo.To be close to her mountains, Tine applied to be a porter for an army expedition. She could carry heavy loads and march for days, shoulder to shoulder with others. But there was one small problem—women were not allowed to be porters. But did that stop her? Of course it didn’t! Tine dressed as a boy and began working. She’d carry nearly  kilos every day. It took a week for everyone to realise that she was a girl disguised as a boy!Tine was scolded for breaking the rules. But she could work as much as the boys and knew the route better than anyone. So the officers agreed to let her continue working. Her act would later help lift the ban on female porters.Tine worked hard and became a coordinator, someone who plans mountain trips. That’s when she met Dr. Romeo Meitei, the leader of an expedition. “I must say that you have all the makings of a naturally gifted climber,” he said. “You have the build, the strength, and the determination. Now all you need, is technique.” Dr. Meitei became her mentor and Tine began her training.But it was when Tine saw The Race for Everest, a film about the first climb of Mount Everest, that she heard about her dream mountain. The Whooshoo became a roar. Climbing Mount Everest became Tine’s dream.Finally, Tine left for Nepal. She was anxious, but determined. At the Everest base camp, it was cold and the air, thin. After her training, Tine began her climb with Cherring Sherpa*. The climb was divided into four sections so climbers could rest at different camping points and continue to the top over a few days. By the time Tine and Cherring Sherpa reached the second camp, the weather had worsened. *Sherpas are a Tibetan ethnic group living in high Himalayan regions who are known for their climbing skills.But the musical Whooooshooing was also growing louder and hypnotic! “Do you want to go ahead?” Cherring asked. “I don’t think I will get another chance to do this,” Tine said.Somehow, they reached their final camp. But the wind blew their tent and supplies away. They found another tent in which they took shelter. No walkietalkies, no medicines, all Tine and Cherring had was a packet of noodles.“Let’s share half of it,” Cherring suggested. “If we make it alive, we will eat the other half,” Tine said with a determined smile. For every two steps they took, the wind sent them reeling back a step. The stormy winds howled, “Go awayyyyy” . But Tine could only hear “Whoooshoooo” .With new resolve, they fearlessly began the last push to reach the top.At .  am on May , , Tine summited the highest mountain in the world. The young girl who loved to climb trees had climbed to the top of the world. She had found her faraway mountain, and was one with the sound that had called her all her life. Whoooshoo, she dances with her beloved mountain.Tine Mena, the mountaineer Tine Mena is an adventurer who holds the distinction of being the first female Everester from Northeast India. At Dr. Romeo Meitei’s suggestion, Tine enrolled at the Manipur Mountaineering and Training Association in Imphal.

Tine turned down a wellpaid job as a mountaineering instructor to chase her Everest dream. She raised private sponsorship for her expedition.Tine has inspired many youngsters in the northeast, starting with her cousin Ruby Lombo, a cycling athlete. Tine continues to be a role model for adventurous children.	./Story text files/536.txt	5004	19	6.178217821782178	374	131	155	57.88235294117647	38	47	26	11.305882352941177	32	53	271	234	5	1.5128644939965694	503	80

This is my house. Ma, Pa and Cheena also live here.The best chair in the house is for me. But sitting on the lap is even better, isn’t it?Cheena is my best friend. I wait for her to return from school.I keep myself clean without water. I do not need a bath like Tommy.Shhh. . . don’t tell anyone that I am hiding here. . . . . . . . . . Got you!Ma shouts at me, when I bring some tasty food from the garden.I can climb trees. I can jump. I know all the short cuts here.Sanju lives nearby. He teases me. It makes me very angry.Please tell Sanju that the tiger is from our cat family. We have sharp claws.My friends sometimes make a lot of noise at night. By then I am quietly in bed.Tails can speak! Did you know how animals and birds tell us something by using their tails? A dog wags its tail when it is happy. A cat puffs up its tail when it is angry. Often we say, “As clean as a cat” . This is because cats do not like water, yet they are always keeping themselves clean by licking themselves.	./Story text files/349.txt	997	12	4.894736842105263	102	12	107	23.95	36	4	19	6.025	27	13	87	27	4	0.9928571428571429	136	4
